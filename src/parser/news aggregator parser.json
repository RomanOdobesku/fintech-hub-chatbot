      "article_text": "Grant Thornton\u2019s retired US partners are demanding a greater share of the spoils from its sale of a majority stake to private equity, after accusing the accounting firm\u2019s management of short-changing them on their pensions.\n\nSome of the 350 former partners entitled to retirement benefits from the firm reacted with anger after being told the payments would be replaced with a one-off lump sum when the deal with New Mountain Capital closes in May, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAfter a fractious call with Grant Thornton\u2019s management last week, retirees said the sum they were offered was unfairly low, in some cases coming up short by $1 million (\u20ac920,000) or more. A group of retired partners, including three former chief executives, are negotiating with the current leadership to try to get a better deal.\n\nGrant Thornton is the seventh-largest accounting firm in the US with $2.4 billion in annual revenue. The sale of a majority stake to New Mountain represents the biggest private equity deal in the sector. Advocates say private equity can bring more efficiency to the profession and access to capital for critical investment, but the financial terms of such deals can prove controversial. Retirees are typically among the firms\u2019 largest creditors but do not have a vote on the sale of the firm.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nGrant Thornton has not publicly disclosed how much New Mountain is paying for its stake, or how exactly the firm will distribute the proceeds of the investment and the new debt that it will also take on. As well as paying off obligations to retirees, the new structure involves repaying capital to current and former partners.\n\nPeople familiar with the retirees\u2019 dispute said it centred on a discount rate being used to calculate the lifetime value of the partners\u2019 retirement benefit. Some retirees also argued that mortality assumptions had been picked to lowball the buyout offer. In addition, there are negative tax implications from getting the benefit in one lump sum, the retirees have said.\n\nOne person said there was a lack of trust between the former partners and members of the current leadership team, and \u201cthis is not the Grant Thornton that we were hired into\u201d.\n\nA Grant Thornton spokesperson said the firm \u201cdeeply values the contributions of our retired partners. We have been speaking with them and look forward to addressing any questions they may have.\u201d\n\nA dozen former partners, including ex-chief executives Brad Preber, Ed Nusbaum and Mike McGuire, have formed a group to \u201cact as a point of contact\u201d with the firm, according to an email it sent to retirees this week.\n\nThe group spoke to current chief executive Seth Siegel on Tuesday \u201cto outline the serious concerns we have heard from you regarding the payment of our retirement benefit\u201d, according to the email, which added: \u201cWhile we continue to explore other options, we will wait for Seth and his leadership team\u2019s response before further reaction.\u201d \u2013 Copyright The Financial Times",

      "article_text": "The results underscore how Huawei, the target of US sanctions and export controls for years, has progressed in navigating through the challenges. Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nHuawei sustained its run of strong quarterly profit growth, building on the resurgence of its consumer business against Apple\u2019s iPhone and the rise of its cloud division against incumbent Alibaba.\n\nThe Chinese networking and electronics leader reported net profit of about 13.9 billion yuan (\u20ac1.8 billion) in the December quarter, based on Bloomberg calculations from its financial figures. That\u2019s more than 65 per cent higher than the 8.4 billion yuan tally a year earlier.\n\nThe results underscore how Huawei, the target of US sanctions and export controls for years, has progressed in navigating through the challenges. In August, the company unveiled its flagship Mate 60 smartphone line-up with a domestically designed and produced 7-nanometer processor, setting off a wave of nationalistic popularity at home. Its consumer electronics division surged by 17.3 per cent in 2023, to bring in sales of 251.5 billion yuan.\n\nHuawei, which was almost knocked out of smartphones and chipmaking after the US cut it off from overseas suppliers in 2019, is emerging as a symbol of China\u2019s determination to thwart Washington\u2019s curbs. It\u2019s now building a network of chipmaking plants to underpin its longer-term ambitions in arenas such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud computing arm grew by nearly 22 per cent during the year, as it made further inroads in competing with Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home. This month, the firm deployed an artificial intelligence-powered weather forecasting model with the meteorological bureau of Shenzhen, its home city. The company\u2019s chips are also showing up in the systems of Chinese AI developers, such as the one used by the Hong Kong-based Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to train an AI assistant for neurosurgeons.\n\nWhile Huawei hasn\u2019t gone as far as Xiaomi, which this week launched its first own-brand EVs, the Shenzhen company\u2019s making progress in providing technology for the automotive sector. That business grew by 128 per cent in 2023, and Huawei has been showing off Aito vehicles in its stores in China.\n\nHuawei\u2019s resurgence coincides with growing pressure on Apple from the Chinese government, which is increasingly mandating or encouraging the use of home-grown devices and technology across different industries and sectors \u2013 including state enterprises. The rise of the Mate 60 has also fired up consumer enthusiasm for local brands.\n\niPhone shipments in China fell about 33 per cent in February from a year earlier, according to official data, extending a slump in demand for the flagship device in its most important overseas market.\n\nBut Huawei in December warned of the dangers a volatile industry and global economy will pose in 2024. In the wake of its 7nm breakthrough, officials in Washington are weighing a variety of responses from blacklisting Huawei suppliers to roping in allies to tighten an existing blockade of semiconductor technology.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said the US will \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d to protect its national security. \u2013 Bloomberg",

      "article_text": "While the concept of \u2018computing as a service\u2019 dates back to the 1960s, the explosion of cloud computing and hyperscale providers as we know it today is a more recent phenomenon. In recent years, particularly post-2020, a \u2018cloud gold rush\u2019 has swept across the business landscape. Driven by the pandemic, companies large and small have scrambled to transition their infrastructure applications to the cloud.\n\nHowever, in their haste to benefit from its headline advantages, many organisations overlooked the full ramifications of their decisions. Now, questions are arising as to why cloud economics don\u2019t always align with expectations, with many CIOs and IT directors finding that the promised savings are elusive, with hidden costs in bandwidth and overlooked payment plans complicating the picture. In many organisations, the cloud model now only truly makes sense if the strategy also leverages automation tools to deliver on its full potential. As a result, many IT professionals are now considering a fundamental question: is the cloud really all it was hyped up to be?\n\nFrom Public to Private\n\nSo, where does that leave organisations who perhaps may be facing a cloud conundrum? For many, the answer lies in a strategic shift to the private cloud \u2013 a distinct approach that contrasts sharply with its public counterpart in a number of important ways:\n\nCustomisation: Tailored to specific needs, the private cloud allows for high levels of customisation and spreads costs over a longer duration. In this context, businesses can dictate the scale of their infrastructure, performance characteristics and compliance standards. This bespoke nature makes it particularly appealing for sectors with stringent regulatory demands or unique operational requirements.\n\nSimplicity: The private cloud caters to volatile computing environments that might not be ideal for the public cloud. For companies with legacy systems or specialised software, for example, transitioning to a private cloud can provide a more controlled and gradual migration path, reducing disruption to ongoing operations.\n\nSecurity: The private cloud also offers more control over data, a capability that is crucial for sensitive workloads. While public providers such as Azure offer high-quality security, private clouds offer more exclusive control. In sectors including finance and healthcare, where data privacy is paramount, the private cloud provides the necessary assurances, while the ability to monitor and manage data and access closely adds a layer of security that is often required in these industries.\n\nIsolation: In addition, the isolated nature of private cloud environments significantly reduces the risk of resource contention, ensuring stable and predictable performance. This isolation is particularly beneficial for organisations running resource-intensive applications, as it guarantees the availability of computational power or storage resources as needed. Moreover, private clouds can offer superior network performance within an organisation, as the data does not have to leave the private network, which can be crucial for bandwidth-intensive applications.\n\nAutonomy: Private clouds also enable organisations to maintain a higher degree of operational autonomy and control over their IT infrastructure. This control extends not just to the technical aspects but also to the governance of data and applications, allowing for a more tailored IT strategy that aligns closely with the organisation\u2019s long-term goals and regulatory requirements.\n\nTransformation: In the current environment where digital transformation is a major area of focus, the adaptability of private cloud infrastructure supports long-term scalability in a controlled environment, which is particularly beneficial for organisations on a transformation journey.\n\nBest of Both Worlds: The Hybrid Cloud\n\nIn practical terms, however, every organisation will have a set of unique requirements, and there\u2019s no universal solution that the cloud can deliver. In these circumstances, a hybrid cloud approach, blending the strengths of both private and public clouds, is arguably the most pragmatic strategy. It\u2019s especially relevant for organisations running legacy software that might operate more effectively on older servers, while the hybrid model also enables a unified management approach across different infrastructures, benefiting from the cost efficiencies of each.\n\nBy adopting a hybrid cloud strategy, businesses can allocate resources more effectively, using the public cloud for scalable, less sensitive tasks while reserving the private cloud for critical, high-security workloads. This flexibility allows for better disaster recovery strategies and operational resilience. Hybrid cloud environments also facilitate innovation, enabling organisations to test new applications in a public cloud setting while maintaining core systems securely on-premises or in a private cloud.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that collaboration with experts is crucial to understanding the capabilities and maturity of different applications. Not every application will thrive in the cloud, and some may be better suited to more traditional solutions. Consulting with cloud architects and IT strategists can help businesses tailor their hybrid cloud environments, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness. As technology evolves, this balanced approach allows organisations to remain agile and adaptable, ready to harness new opportunities while maintaining a secure and stable IT foundation.",

For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has been a token of particular interest to investors, thanks to its meteoric rise and the robust community that supports it. However, as we look towards 2024, some top analysts are casting a shadow of doubt over the return on investment (ROI) that holding Shiba Inu (SHIB) might yield. Amid discussions on market volatility, changing investor sentiment, and the emergence of new cryptocurrencies like Shiba Budz (BUDZ), this article delves into the skepticism surrounding SHIB\u2019s future performance and what it could mean for investors currently holding or considering SHIB as a long-term investment.\n\nAnalysts Cast Doubt on SHIB\u2019s Future ROI\n\nAs Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market, top analysts are expressing concerns about its potential ROI by 2024. These concerns are rooted in a variety of factors, including market saturation, the potential for regulatory changes, and the inherent unpredictability of meme coins.\n\nMarket Volatility and Investor Sentiment: A Double-Edged Sword\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is no exception. While volatility can lead to high returns, it also introduces significant risks. Investor sentiment, often driven by trends and social media, can dramatically influence SHIB\u2019s price. Analysts point to this volatility and the fickle nature of investor sentiment as key reasons why SHIB\u2019s ROI by 2024 may not meet investors\u2019 expectations. This part of the article examines how these factors contribute to the uncertainty surrounding Shiba Inu (SHIB)\u2019s future performance.\n\nShiba Budz (BUDZ) and Other Alternatives\n\nAmid the discussions on SHIB\u2019s potential, the emergence of new cryptocurrencies like Shiba Budz (BUDZ) is offering investors alternative avenues for potentially higher returns. Shiba Budz (BUDZ), with its unique value proposition and connection to the Ethereum ecosystem, is quickly gaining attention as a viable investment.\n\nNavigating the Future: Implications for SHIB Holders\n\nFor investors holding Shiba Inu (SHIB), the skepticism from analysts regarding its 2024 ROI necessitates a strategic approach to portfolio management. With the potential for new regulations, shifts in market dynamics, and the introduction of promising new tokens like Shiba Budz (BUDZ), Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders may need to consider diversification as a way to mitigate risk and capitalize on emerging opportunities. This part of the article explores strategies for SHIB investors to navigate the uncertain future, highlighting the importance of staying informed and agile in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nConclusion: A Time for Caution and Opportunity\n\nAs we move closer to 2024, the debate over Shiba Inu (SHIB)\u2019s (SHIB) return on investment continues to garner attention from investors and analysts alike. While some express doubts about Shiba Inu (SHIB)\u2019s ability to deliver significant returns, the emergence of new cryptocurrencies like Shiba Budz (BUDZ) provides a reminder of the ever-present opportunities within the crypto market. For SHIB holders, the current climate is one of both caution and potential opportunity, requiring a balanced approach to investment that considers the diverse and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nIn summary, the skepticism surrounding Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) potential ROI by 2024 highlights the complex interplay of market volatility, investor sentiment, and the competitive pressure from emerging cryptocurrencies like Shiba Budz (BUDZ). As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are faced with the challenge of navigating this uncertainty, underscoring the need for careful analysis, diversification, and a strategic mindset to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nFor more information on the Shiba Budz (BUDZ) Presale:\n\nPresale Website: SHIBA BUDZ (BUDZ)\n\nUse Promo Code budzmoon30 to get 30% bonus\n\nJoin and become a BUDZ member:\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/ShibaBudzP2E\n\nTwitter: SHIBA BUDZ \u201c$BUDZ\u201d (@ShibaBudz) / X",

It has launched a campaign to help businesses spot the signs.\n\n\u201cCriminals hack directly into company email accounts or create new ones that are almost impossible to tell from the real thing,\u201d the bank warned.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n\u201cThey email staff members posing as their manager, instructing them to urgently transfer money to a new account. They also pose as suppliers asking staff to change their payment details.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are urged to ensure that all staff are aware of this threat and are reminded that when it comes to making payments or transferring money, never act on email instructions alone. Instead, talk to the person directly on a trusted phone number.\u201d\n\nAIB head of financial crime Carol Lawton said: \u201cCriminals will try to take advantage of this period. Fraud can be very distressing for businesses as it often involves significant amounts of money.\n\n\u201cThese scams can be very sophisticated, and criminals go to great lengths to defraud by compromising people\u2019s emails or computers, sending emails and messages that appear legitimate, and creating high-quality online advertisements, brochures and other materials.\n\n\u201cWe also know that criminals use legitimate names and job titles of people working in various companies, including plausible impersonations, in an attempt to appear genuine.\u201d\n\nOn investment scams, AIB said they were \u201chighly sophisticated\u201d and that \u201cexperienced business people\u201d can be taken in by them.\n\n\u201cCriminals create fake websites promising far higher returns than usual,\u201d it said. \u201cThe websites will always have a page that looks for contact details to allow criminals make their first contact with you. They will call or text from numbers that look genuine and often supply high-quality brochures.\n\n\u201cBusiness people are urged to remember that if something seems too good to be true, then it probably is. Always check that a firm is regulated and check that the person you\u2019re talking to really works there.\u201d\n\nIn terms of malware, it warned businesses that criminals can make fake bank websites that look exactly like the real thing, but which contain malicious software.\n\nThis software is designed to then get unauthorised access to computer systems and steal information.\n\n\u201cFor example, with malware, if you search for your bank\u2019s website instead of typing it in, you might get a pop up asking for login information or a one-time code, giving criminals all the information they need to begin taking money from you,\u201d AIB said.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are reminded to never browse the web for their bank\u2019s website, never enter financial information into pop-up windows and keep antivirus software up to date.\u201d",

      "article_text": "When it comes to financial justice, no perpetrator wants to find themselves before an American judge, writes Alex Brummer.\n\nAs the guardians of free market capitalism, the courts in the US regard white-collar crime with the same solemnity as other misdemeanours and sentence severely.\n\nFTX's youthful founder Sam Bankman-Fried finds himself up there in the pantheon of great US fraudsters, along with Bernie Ebbers, the chief executive of Worldcom and Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco, both of whom received 25-year sentences.\n\nOnly the late Bernie Madoff, sentenced to an astonishing 150 years, received a greater stretch. The Holocaust survivor, writer and Nobel prize winner Elie Wiesel, who was among Madoff's victims, said at the time the greatest punishment for Madoff would be to sit in his cell with a perpetual relay of pictures of his victims.\n\nMaybe Bankman-Fried should be provided a similar punishment.\n\nBusiness Bulletin\n\nThe difference is that in the shadowy, mysterious world of crypto-currency, there is so much anonymity that no one really knows who they are dealing with. That is why bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are the favoured means of exchange of terrorist groups including Hamas and Isis.\n\nIt took the events of October 7 in Israel to galvanise the US Department of Justice and the Israeli authorities into closing down crypto wallets.\n\nIn addition to his 25-year sentence Bankman-Fried has a world-class bill to settle. Judge Lewis Kaplan imposed $11bn (\u00a38.6bn) of financial penalties.\n\nThat places the $355m (\u00a3277m) civil fine levied on Donald Trump, for inflating the value of his assets to obtain loans from his bankers, in perspective.\n\nJudge Kaplan was unimpressed with\n\nBankman-Fried's claims that FTX customers and creditors would be paid in full. He compared the mop-haired millennial to a thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas, successfully bets the stolen cash, and then asks for an easier sentence because he might be able to use his gambling winnings to pay back victims.\n\nBankman-Fried enjoyed a lavish lifestyle in the Caribbean, was courted by heads of state and gave enormous sums to Democratic candidates. He vowed to use his wealth to better humanity.\n\nOther convicted cheats, such as the insider trader Ivan Boesky (whose trial I covered in 1987) tried the same tactic, giving tens of millions away to universities.\n\nWhen he was sent down for five years, his name was torn down from the endowed buildings.\n\nWhat is most troubling about Bankman-Fried and the skulduggery uncovered at Binance, resulting in a $4bn fine for boss Changpeng Zhao, is the lack of discipline it has brought to Wild West crypto markets.\n\nQuite the opposite. Bitcoin reached a new peak of $71,419 this month, almost doubling from its price in July 2021.\n\nThe reluctant decision of the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, to authorise exchange traded funds (ETFs) holding crypto gave a lease of life to an asset class favoured by crooks, terrorists and uninitiated speculators.\n\nTheir holdings have transmogrified into great wealth. It is unbelievable that financial markets, there to provide capital and liquidity to respectable traded companies, should allow interlopers.\n\nThere is no question that eventually, when central banks get their act together, government-backed digital currency will become a factor. It may even change the architecture of banking as we know it.\n\nNo one should begin to think that bitcoin and its ilk have any intrinsic value.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, billionaire and former chief executive officer of Binance Holdings Ltd. Photographer: Zed Jameson/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe process of mining and creation are shrouded in fantasy. The algorithms used to create them consume vast quantities of energy in a world where investment is often judged on climate change values.\n\nAs the Bankman-Fried case shows, unregulated crypto assets, run from sundrenched offshore islands, are an invitation to fraudulent behaviour.\n\nFortunes may have been made by those with the good sense to sell on the way up and transfer winnings into fiat currencies.\n\nNo one should expect sympathy or compensation when the crypto bubble bursts? as it surely will.\n\nPhoto: Former Chief Executive Officer of FTX Trading Limited Sam Bankman-Fried.

For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nIn the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, where the title of \u201cAltcoin King\u201d is always up for grabs, Solana (SOL) has long enjoyed the throne, celebrated for its lightning-fast blockchain technology and strong developer community. However, a new contender has emerged, challenging the supremacy of Solana (SOL) with a unique proposition that has caught the eye of investors and analysts alike. The newcomer, Option2Trade (O2T), an A.I-driven exchange token, is making headlines, with analysts predicting it could reach $1 before Q4 2024, signaling a potential shift in the altcoin hierarchy.\n\nOption2Trade (O2T): The Rise of A.I in Crypto\n\nOption2Trade (O2T) differentiates itself by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize the trading experience. It aims to provide traders with predictive market analytics, automated trading strategies, and a level of personalized investment insight previously unseen in the crypto space. This innovative approach to trading, coupled with the token\u2019s rapid adoption rate, has positioned Option2Trade (O2T) as a formidable force, capable of dethroning established players like Solana (SOL).\n\nSolana (SOL): The Reigning Altcoin King\n\nSolana (SOL) has been lauded for its scalability and efficiency, offering a compelling platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Its technology, which allows for thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of its competitors, has solidified its position as a leader in the altcoin market. However, as the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the emergence of tokens like Option2Trade (O2T) that offer not just technological advancements but also practical, real-world utility, poses a significant challenge to Solana (SOL)\u2019s dominance.\n\nWhy Option2Trade (O2T) Stands Out\n\nInnovative Use of A.I: Unlike Solana (SOL), which focuses on blockchain speed and efficiency, Option2Trade (O2T) leverages artificial intelligence to enhance trading outcomes, appealing to a broader range of investors seeking intelligent investment solutions.\n\nMarket Potential: The enthusiastic market response to Option2Trade (O2T), including its notable price surge, underscores its potential to disrupt the traditional altcoin market, challenging established coins like Solana (SOL).\n\nPredicted Growth: Analysts\u2019 prediction of a $1 valuation for Option2Trade (O2T) before Q4 2024 reflects confidence in its growth trajectory, driven by its unique value proposition and technological innovation.\n\nAdoption Rate: The rapid adoption of Option2Trade (O2T), evidenced by its expanding user base, indicates a market readiness for A.I-driven trading platforms, offering a competitive edge over Solana (SOL).\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem: While Solana (SOL) boasts a robust developer community, Option2Trade (O2T) is quickly building its ecosystem, centered around the innovative use of A.I, which could attract a diverse group of users beyond traditional crypto enthusiasts.\n\nImplications for Solana (SOL)\n\nThe challenge posed by Option2Trade (O2T) to Solana (SOL)\u2019s position as the \u201cAltcoin King\u201d is emblematic of the constant evolution of the cryptocurrency market. For Solana (SOL), staying ahead may require exploring new technological integrations or expanding its utility to include A.I-driven functionalities that can match the offerings of tokens like Option2Trade (O2T).\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the emergence of A.I-driven tokens like Option2Trade (O2T) represents the next frontier in crypto trading and investment. With its innovative approach and promising market response, Option2Trade (O2T) is poised to challenge the dominance of established altcoins like Solana (SOL). The prediction of Option2Trade (O2T) reaching $1 before Q4 2024 not only highlights its potential for significant growth but also signals a shift in investor preferences towards platforms that offer intelligent, data-driven insights. As the battle for the altcoin crown heats up, the rise of Option2Trade (O2T) may very well herald a new era in the crypto kingdom, where A.I is king.\n\nFor more information on the Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T) Presale:\n\nUse promo code O2TLaunch to get 15% bonus\n\nVisit Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T)\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\n\n\nhttps://t.me/O2TOfficial%20\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Option2Trade%20(O2T)",

      "article_text": "Patience remains gold-mining investment's key virtue...\n\nGOLD MINING stocks are among the most hated equities in the stock market, but that will change as the macro shifts in their favor for the first time since 2001-2003, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.\n\nIt is the nature of the masses, the majority, the consensus...the HERD...to follow the trend.\n\nIt is a lot easier to swim downstream than to fight the current. Just go with the flow. And from a US-centric view the flow has, with a blessed interruption from 2001 to 2003, been inflationary monetary policy free flowing into asset markets as needed and on demand at every point of financial crisis since. Armageddon '08 and the Covid crash were two primary examples.\n\nWith the 30-year Treasury bond yield 'Continuum' lower squarely showing a disinflationary trend for decades, full license was given to our policy heroes to act, mopping up each crisis with an unrelenting fire hose of 'Whatever it takes!' monetary policy.\n\nThrow in a side order of government (democrat or republican) always willing to spend and stimulate its favored areas (often very different areas per the party in power, but favored areas nonetheless) and you've got an ongoing bubble in monetary and fiscal policy. You also got a toxic environment for the wretched companies that dig the monetary metal (which is well outside the 'debt for growth' system) out of the ground.\n\nThis chart tells a story of something that was in place for decades (going back to the 1980s, not shown on this chart) that is no longer in place.\n\n30 year Treasury yield continuum, which implies a new macro and a new era for gold stocks\n\nIn my opinion, markets operating as if all is as it has been (hello US headline indexes, bad breadth and all) are dead men walking.\n\nThe Continuum is a pictorial view of the funding mechanism of the bubble. Well, the mechanism is severely altered, if not broken.\n\nI began this post with the intention to keep it very simple and have already veered from that course. So let's get it back on course. Let's take a look at gold mining stocks through the prism of their relationship to gold and gold's relationship to other markets.\n\nThis daily chart shows that in 2023 gold stocks (HUI) had rightly traveled both positively and negatively in line with their best fundamental gauges. Those are gold's relationships with commodities and inflation.\n\nWhen gold declined in relation to inflation signalers like 'inflation expectations' gauge RINF and commodity index GNX, gold stocks declined right along with them. As it became apparent that inflation was weakening and gold rose vs. those items, gold stocks rallied.\n\nThen came the disconnect and positive divergence (for gold stocks) by gold's relationship to the inflation signalers (RINF, GNX, etc). I believe this happened because the herd finally bought the disinflationary 'Goldilocks' (soft landing or even NO landing) story as euphoria set in and Tech/Growth stocks gained momentum.\n\nThe hard decline by HUI from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 aped the decline in gold vs. the stock market (SPX). Of course, the HUI/Gold ratio tagged right along.\n\n\"Gold stocks suck!\" demands the herd. And the herd is right; for now.\n\nThe NFTRH view has for over a year been for disinflationary Goldilocks to be followed by an uncomfortable decline in inflation. In other words, a deflation scare, quite possibly as a precursor to the next terrible inflation phase out in 2025 or thereafter.\n\nWith indexes like SPX, NDX and SOX still orbiting in blue sky the Gold/SPX ratio is in the tank and right along with it have been gold stocks (and their ratio to gold). While Gold/GNX and Gold/RINF have represented a positive divergence for gold stocks, Gold/SPX has been quite the opposite. Hence, we await the end of the currently at high risk bull market in stocks.\n\nHere is the same chart, expanded to a long-term view showing the 2001-2003 period when Gold/SPX rose, Gold/GNX rose and by extension, HUI/Gold and nominal HUI rose. There was no such thing as an 'inflation expectations' ETF back then, but using TIP/TLT or TIP/IEF, you'd get the same result; gold rising in relation to those ratios.\n\nAfter 2003, gold mining stocks entered a bubble as they blasted off to the stratosphere despite a negative macro as gold under-performed commodities and flat lined vs. stocks during that inflationary time.\n\nI usually disregard political rancor in my analysis, but this year I have been hit over the head with the fact that the Fed has been monetizing out the back door while playing tough guy on TV (to the public).\n\nIt is not lost on me that Biden administration Treasury Secretary Yellen is the Fed chief who preceded Powell and is probably hard wired to him. My tin foil hat thesis is that she's got his ear, if she's not actively coordinating with him.\n\nHere again is NFTRH subscriber Michael Pollaro's graph showing the sneaky monetization of debt ongoing, as if a regulator or pressure release to its hawkish Fed Funds policy as consumed by the public.\n\nAs a side note, to say I am proud of and even awed by the sophistication of the NFTRH subscriber base would be an understatement. This man has been doing this kind of work longer and much more astutely than I.\n\nSo we have established that the Fed has been hawkish, but not really. Now let's also consider that the massively contentious, rancorous and frankly, scary election year of 2024 is for all the marbles. Let's consider that the Biden administration has got the Semiconductor CHIPS Act in its hip pocket as well as whatever new 'Green' and/or 'infrastructure' initiatives it may activate to temporarily stimulate the economy.\n\nIn my view they will hold some cards close to the vest until a strategic moment this election year and then let 'er rip. The Trump candidacy could be incinerated in one fell swoop if the economy gets goosed at the right time.\n\nThe above represents both Monetary (Fed) and Fiscal (government) policy potentials and is a reason I have had to revise my original view for the stock rally from Q1-Q2, and then Q4, 2023 to potentially into or even through the 2024 election. \"Potentially\", mind you. With the risk levels (by so many indicators beyond the scope of this article, but illustrated frequently over the last several months) currently in play, a condition (although not a timer) for a top is already in place.\n\nCircling back to gold stocks, the miners' product is doing just fine, up there in blue sky as well. Although gold's blue sky is nothing like the bubble beneficiaries like the major stock indexes. But if, like me, you think the stock market is a dead man walking, it will only be a matter of time before the macro fully aligns for gold stocks and the massive pro-stocks herd, which would never consider a filthy investment like gold stocks, ends up wrong as it always does sooner or later.\n\nIt's been a long time since 2003. A couple decades is too long to fight a market based on principle. I believe strongly in giving my best effort to illustrate what I see, not what I want to see.\n\nWhat I see now is a big macro shift in progress. Not complete, but methodically progressing.\n\nPatience.",

      "article_text": "The recent rally in oil prices is pushing the benchmarks towards a quarter of gains thanks to the OPEC+ output cuts.\n\nFriday, March 29, 2024\n\nThe oil markets are increasingly putting their trust into OPEC+ production cuts to remain in place throughout this year, a feat which combined with an improving macroeconomic outlook could bring $90 per barrel sooner than assumed. A better-than-expected Q4 for US GDP will most probably consolidate market expectations around a June interest rate cut, leaving behind the demand woes of early 2024. ICE Brent is set to close the week around the $87 per barrel mark, whilst WTI is trading around $83 per barrel.\n\nBaltimore Closure Weighs Heavily on US Coal. The indefinite closure of the Port of Baltimore after the Francis Scott Key bridge collapsed this week will impact US thermal coal exports as Baltimore accounted for 28% of all seaborne outflows, affecting key shippers Arch Resources, Consol and Javelin.\n\nUS SPR Replenishment Cost Increasingly More. The latest round of strategic petroleum stock replenishments in the US, totalling 2.8 million barrels in September, has seen the average price hit $81.32 per barrel, above the $79 per barrel threshold that the White House mandated for refilling crude SPRs.\n\nIraq Extends Iran Gas Supply Deal for 5 Years. Iran agreed on an extension of a gas supply deal with Iraq for another five years, with Tehran sending up to 50 million cubic meters per day, accounting for approximately one-third of Iraq\u2019s electricity generation in the peak-demand summer months.\n\nLibya Oil Minister Fired Amidst Corruption Probe. Libya\u2019s oil minister Mohamed Aoun was replaced within hours of his suspension with a replacement named from within the board of the state oil firm NOC, with Libya\u2019s Tripoli government seeking to greenlight several multi-billion projects that he blocked.\n\nChile Urges SQM-Tianqi to Settle Scores. After China\u2019s lithium giant Tianqi Lithium (SHE:002466), holding 20% in Chile\u2019s SQM (NYSE:SQM), raised concerns over transparency in the Chilean company\u2019s relationship with copper producer Codelco, the spat escalated to a governmental level with Chile\u2019s Energy Ministry calling for a peaceful resolution.\n\nUK\u2019s Best Oil Eyes Eni Link-Up. UK offshore oil producer Ithaca Energy (LON:ITH), the majority owner of the controversial Cambo heavy oil project, is reportedly in talks with Italian major ENI (BIT:ENI) in a deal that would see Ithaca gain 40-45,000 b/d of producing assets whilst ENI would get a 38-39% stake in Ithaca.\n\nUS Treasury Targets Iran Oil Trade. In its sixth round of targeted Iran sanctions, the US Department of Treasury sanctioned Sa\u2019id al-Jamal, a Houthi-linked network of companies that allegedly moves Iranian commodities through forged documents, as well as the Panama-flagged tanker Dawn II.\n\nNigeria Prompts Oil Producers to Keep Their Crude at Home. Representatives of Nigeria\u2019s oil regulator NUPRC have met with the African country\u2019s crude producers as their commitments to supply Nigerian crude to domestic refineries have been disappointing, with oil firms bemoaning the lack of payment guarantees.\n\nBrazil Sees Buildup of Russian Diesel Tankers. Bloomberg reports that over 3.7 million barrels of Russian diesel has been idling in waters near the Brazilian coast, underscoring the growing bottlenecks in Russian energy deliveries as at least two tankers belong to sanctioned shipper Sovcomflot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMexico\u2019s Crude Output Falls to Lowest Since 1979. Crude production of Mexico\u2019s state oil company Pemex fell to its lowest monthly level in 45 years this February, pumping 1.55 million b/d of oil, with the world\u2019s most indebted firm coming well below the government-set output target of 1.9 million b/d.\n\nKenya and Uganda Settle Their Import Spat. Kenya will allow landlocked Uganda to import oil products through its port of Mombasa, ending a longstanding dispute between the two neighbours, as Uganda\u2019s government handed over exclusive oil product supply rights to global trading firm Vitol.\n\nNew Senegal President Questions Oil Deals. Senegal\u2019s newly elected President Bassirou Faye intends to revisit the contractual terms offered to oil companies BP (NYSE:BP), Kosmos Energy (NYSE:KOS) and Woodside Energy (ASX:WDS), making good on his pre-election pledge to increase the state\u2019s ownership of the Grand Tortue and Sangomar projects.\n\nVietnam Draws Closer to Qatari LNG. Vietnam will be ramping up LNG imports after the July 2023 commissioning of its Thi Vai LNG import terminal, signing its first ever LNG supply deal with Qatar for an April-delivery cargo as the South Asian country\u2019s power demand is expected to grow 10-12% per year.\n\nBy Michael Kern for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

The goals of the strike were achieved. All the targets were struck,\" The ministry said.\n\nUkraine's largest power provider, DTEK, said that three of its thermal power stations were targeted in the overnight attacks. According to the Ukrainian military, the attack included dozens of missiles and at least 60 explosive drones\u2014all aimed at energy infrastructure. Ukraine said that 84 of 99 missiles were shot down, but the late-night attacks did manage to damage Ukraine's energy assets in six separate regions, some of which triggered emergency shutdowns.\n\nThe Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure come after Ukraine stepped up its drone attacks on Russian refineries in recent weeks, reducing Russia's overall refinery capacity and cutting into Russia's refinery output, including gasoline and diesel production for its own domestic market. The United States had urged Ukraine to stop its attacks on Russia's refineries on concerns that any Russian retaliation could result in a spike in crude oil prices. Rising crude oil prices, which lead to higher gasoline prices, are problematic for sitting U.S. presidents in election years.\n\nCrude oil prices were trading up on Friday morning, with Brent reaching $87 per barrel\u2014an increase of 1.86% on the day or $1.59 per barrel.\n\nEarlier this week, Russia attacked an underground natural gas storage site in Ukraine, but the attack did not disrupt supply.\n\nBy Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

There were no injuries or damage reported to U.S. or coalition ships,\u201d Centcom added in the statement.\n\n\u201cIt was determined these weapons presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the region. These actions are taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for U.S. Navy and merchant vessels,\u201d it continued.\n\nIn a separate post on its X page on March 27, Centcom revealed that, on that day, between 2am and 2.20am Sanaa time, it \u201csuccessfully engaged and destroyed four long-range unmanned aerial systems launched by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese UAS were aimed at a U.S. warship and engaged in self-defense over the Red Sea. There were no injuries or damage reported to U.S. or coalition ships,\u201d it added in that post.\n\nIn an X post published on March 24, Centcom announced that, from 2.50am to 4.30am Sanaa time on March 23, \u201cthe Iranian-backed Houthis launched four anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM) into the Red Sea in the vicinity of M/V Huang Pu, a Panamanian-flagged, Chinese-owned, Chinese-operated oil tanker\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt 4.25pm Sanaa time, a fifth ballistic missile was detected as fired toward M/V Huang Pu. The ship issued a distress call but did not request assistance. M/V Huang Pu suffered minimal damage, and a fire on board was extinguished within 30 minutes,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cNo casualties were reported, and the vessel resumed its course. The Houthis attacked the MV Huang despite previously stating they would not attack Chinese vessels,\u201d it continued.\n\nIn that post, Centcom also noted that, between 6.50am and 9.50am Sanaa time, U.S. forces, including USS Carney (DDG 64), \u201cengaged six Houthi unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) over the southern Red Sea\u201d.\n\n\u201cFive crashed into the Red Sea, and one flew inland into Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. It was determined these UAVs presented an imminent threat to U.S., coalition, and merchant vessels in the region,\u201d it added.\n\nDryad Global\u2019s latest Maritime Security Threat Advisory (MSTA), which was released this week, designates Yemen with a \u201ccritical\u201d risk and impact rating and highlights several incidents in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The only other countries with a critical rating in the MSTA are Ukraine and Syria.\n\nIn a statement posted on its website on March 22, the Royal Navy noted that a Royal Navy led emergency center \u201chas dealt with an \u2018unprecedented\u2019 rise in distress calls due to the Red Sea crisis\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe team at the UK Maritime Trade Organization (UKMTO), based on Portsdown Hill overlooking Portsmouth, are dealing with two or three reports of attacks and incidents daily \u2013 compared with monthly \u2013 as a result of the wave of attacks on shipping in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe statement noted that the UKMTO\u2019s operators monitor thousands of ships moving across an area ten times the size of the North Sea, \u201cas well as a similar size of the Atlantic Ocean focused on the Gulf of Guinea which has suffered piracy and criminal activity, though not to the same extent\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve seen a 475 per cent increase in incidents reported by seafarers in the Middle East since attacks began in the autumn, with over 2,500 emails coming into the HQ daily,\u201d the statement said.\n\nLieutenant Commander Joanna Black was quoted as saying in the statement, \u201cthere are times when we take a call from very distressed mariners as an attack is taking place \u2013 for them it\u2019s a potentially life-changing moment\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can hear the gunfire, perhaps banging or an explosion \u2013 it\u2019s real time and you can see from the look on the team\u2019s faces what is happening,\u201d Black added.\n\n\u201cWe are rooting for the seafarers and do everything we can for them.

      "article_text": "March has been an exciting month for cryptocurrencies, with a rally that led to a new Bitcoin (BTC) all-time high near $73,000 and then a correction that saw a significant crash across the board.\n\nAs the month is drawing to a close \u2013 and the month of the highly-anticipated BTC halving is drawing ever nearer \u2013 the crypto market is again eying a rise in value, especially given few of the big coins and tokens in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are in the red on both the daily and weekly charts.\n\nSince there is likely to be much excitement in the coming weeks \u2013 and likely several major surges \u2013 Finbold decided to take a look at a couple of cryptocurrencies that may well be worth investing $500 or more in April.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nWhile Polkadot (DOT) has remained relatively under the radar in 2024, the cryptocurrency has actually offered multiple exciting developments that are either already live or are actively in the works.\n\nFor one, the Polkadot network logged a new non-fungible token (NFT) minting speed record through its parachain \u2013 Unique Network \u2013 having reached nearly 5,000 NFTs per minute.\n\nAdditionally, a dedicated team is actively working on a new meme coin \u2013 DED \u2013 which has already gained significant traction within the community and might not only provide a boost for DOT itself but could also constitute the latest such project to explode once released.\n\nFinally, Polkadot appears to be readying itself for its next big rally based on its recent performance as it has recently started breaking out of a correction it entered following the previous surge.\n\nThe last 30 days saw DOT trade with significant volatility but remain 12.70% in the green while the token is 9.06% up on the weekly chart. Polkadot price today has also changed in a positive direction as it climbed 1.25% to $9.64.\n\nDOT 1-month price chart. Source: FInbold\n\nDOT\u2019s relative quietness during the ongoing rally and the fact that is still well below its all-time highs near $53 also make it a good candidate for a continued surge \u2013 particularly with the recent string of developments in mind.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nThe oldest meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE) also appears like a strong buy at April\u2019s doorstep. Not only has the month historically been at least somewhat kind to the cryptocurrency type, but there has been a growing interest in the coin.\n\nIndeed, in the last two weeks, whales accumulated approximately $280 million worth of DOGE helping its market cap surge approximately $7 billion in the time frame and creating new higher support zones with a likely continued Bitcoin rally nearly guaranteeing a continuous Dogecoin surge.\n\nOn the price side, Dogecoin has also been doing well in recent times and is up 140.03% since the start of 2024. Most recently, it has been on a rampage breaking above $0.2 and retesting the resistance at $0.22.\n\nDOGE YTD price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe uptrend has been particularly strong in the last 30 days of trading which saw the meme coin surge 66.34% and the most recent time frames have also been generally strong with DOGE climbing 45.15% in the last 7 days to $0.216 \u2013 highest it has been since November 2021.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nTLDR\n\nDOGE is set to resume its bullish ascent.\n\nSHIB could decrease to $0.000008 in 2024.\n\n$RECQ brings 525% gains before the launch.\n\nCrypto analysts believe that Dogecoin (DOGE) will manage to sustain its bullish momentum in the following term. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) lagging price action has resulted in bearish forecasts for the meme coin\u2019s upcoming performance. On the other hand, top market experts suggest Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RECQ as the best coin to invest in 2024 due to its fantastic growth potential.\n\nDOGE Aims For the $0.30 Threshold\n\nDogecoin bulls suggest DOGE as the top crypto to invest in 2024 based on Dogecoin\u2019s impressive price performance and the token\u2019s continued rallies in terms of trading volume. Furthermore, some of Elon Musk\u2019s recent posts on X have sparked speculations that the platform could soon integrate DOGE as a payment method.\n\nHence, multiple crypto analysts have given a positive DOGE price prediction, stating that Dogecoin could increase above the $0.30 mark by the year\u2019s close. DOGE traded at around $0.18 during the last week of March, which means that Dogecoin holders could obtain more than 66.66% gains.\n\nOn the other hand, Dogecoin bears expect significant dips within the next DOGE price movements due to the meme coin\u2019s increased market volatility. As for the latest negative Dogecoin price forecast, DOGE could decrease to under $0.09 by the end of 2024.\n\nSHIB Bears Expect Dips Toward $0.000008\n\nAccording to Shiba Inu bears, SHIB could decrease to $0.000008 by the end of the year as holders switch over to other platforms that bring more significant short-term gains. SHIB traded around the $0.000030 range during the final week of March, meaning that Shiba Inu could decrease by as much as 73.33% over the forthcoming term.\n\nHowever, Shiba Inu supporters praise SHIB as a good crypto to buy due to its massive future potential and Shiba Inu\u2019s excellent ranking by market capitalization. On top of that, the Australian-based exchange Bitcoin.com.au enabled trading in SHIB on March 25.\n\nTherefore, Shiba Inu bulls are convinced that SHIB could manage to exceed the $0.000050 level by the end of 2024. Analysts point to Shiba Inu\u2019s remarkable surges in terms of TVL as another important factor behind this bullish SHIB price prediction.\n\nSeasoned Investors Pick $RECQ as the Best Cryptocurrency To Buy Now\n\nRebel Satoshi is an exciting meme coin project that is poised to spearhead the new decentralized revolution. Additionally, Rebel Satoshi\u2019s community-based approach empowers token holders to receive extraordinary rewards for participating in the platform\u2019s vibrant two token ecosystem.\n\nThe amazing $RBLZ token grants governance rights and other exclusive benefits, such as access to token burns and discounts on Rebel Satoshi merchandise. On top of that, $RBLZ raised over $2.5 million during the presale and launched at $0.025 on the Uniswap DEX on March 4.\n\nMeanwhile, Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RECQ is priced at only $0.002 at the Early Bird Stage of the token\u2019s presale, which means that investors are looking at astonishing 525% gains when $RECQ attains the $0.0125 presale target. Furthermore, $RECQ provides exclusive access to the incredible Rebel Satoshi Arcade and boasts excellent utility as Rebel Satoshi\u2019s base currency for everyday transactions.\n\n$RECQ has the potential to outclass DOGE and SHIB and emerge as the next leader in the meme coin market, so don\u2019t hesitate to join Rebel Satoshi\u2019s uprising today!\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram",

According to the accounts, \u201cthe capital contribution represents a gift received from Brown-Forman Netherlands BV\u201d, its immediate parent company. The accounts note that this gift was \u201cbeing made with the intention and understanding that it will be irrevocable, non-refundable and unconditional in all respects\u201d.\n\nWhile the company is owned by Brown Forman, it is still run by the Conynghams. In a recent interview with The Spirits Business, a drinks industry trade magazine, Alex Conyngham said that \u201cwhile it was technically an acquisition, I would say it\u2019s more of a partnership, because the family is still very involved, and a Conyngham family member will always sit on the board of the company, and I personally take an active role in product development.\u201d\n\nSlane Castle is owned by Henry Conyngham and has for years been most famous as the site of a semi-regular concert he has held in the castle grounds since 1981, with famous acts over the years including Thin Lizzy, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, U2, Madonna and, more recently, Harry Styles.",

      "article_text": "Pay dispute could see new Airbus A321XLR aircraft reallocated within IAG group\n\nAer Lingus is due to receive two of the new Airbus A321XLR jets this year\n\nAer Lingus has is just weeks away from seeing a new Airbus A321 XLR jet that was due to join its fleet this year reallocated by parent IAG to another group carrier as a result of a continuing pay dispute, the airline has warned.\n\nThe airline has requested a meeting with the Irish Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (IALPA) to see if a resolution can be achieved within the next four weeks before a decision on the painting of the new aircraft in Aer Lingus livery must be made.\n\nIt\u2019s understood that the pilot union has agreed to the request and that a meeting between the sides will be held next week.\n\nThe airline and the union are set to clash at the Labour Court as it begins considering the pay dispute on April 22. That followed failed efforts to reach agreement at the Workplace Relations Commission.\n\nAer Lingus, whose chief executive is Lynne Embleton, is part of the IAG group that also owns British Airways, Iberia and Vueling.\n\nThe airline has told IALPA that deliveries of the A321XLR jets that were due to join the Aer Lingus fleet have now been paused.\n\nAer Lingus had anticipated receiving two of the jets in the final quarter of this year, but IAG chief executive Luis Gallego said last month that without a pilot pay agreement at the airline, those jets might now be deployed elsewhere within the group. The XLR aircraft can be used to serve the United States from Ireland.\n\n\u201cThe original idea was that they were going to fly in Aer Lingus, but today, I can tell you, without an agreement [with pilots], they\u2019re not going to fly in Aer Lingus,\u201d he said.\n\nA decision must be made by the end of April regarding the livery for the first of the A321XLR jets that was due for delivery for Aer Lingus.\n\nIf a pay agreement can\u2019t be reached by then, the jet would likely be allocated to another airline within the IAG group.\n\nIn order to avoid that, Aer Lingus wants to see if an agreement can be thrashed out with pilots before the painting deadline and the potential loss of the jet to another IAG carrier.\n\n\u201cWhile we remain fully committed to the Labour Court process, the above timeline requires a decision on painting to be made by 28th April, which is not possible given current Labour Court\u2019s date, expected timelines for any recommendation and subsequent consideration by Aer Lingus, IALPA and any ballot,\u201d Aer Lingus chief operations officer Adrian Dunne told IALPA president Mark Tighe in a letter this week.\n\n\u201cIt is incumbent on us to try to find a solution as soon as possible,\u201d he added.\n\nThe airline warned pilots in a letter earlier this month that the potential loss of the planned A321XLR aircraft scheduled for delivery to Aer Lingus this year would immediately reduce its pilot requirement by 80 and its command requirement by 40.\n\nAn independent Pilot Pay Tribunal had last year recommended a 12.25pc increase in consolidated pay and a 1.5pc rise in unconsolidated pay for Aer Lingus pilots.\n\nIALPA\u2019s pay proposal includes a 20pc pay rise and the additional 7pc covering the cost by pilots of a 2019 crewing agreement. The 12.25pc proposed by the carrier included a 3.75pc to pay for that crewing agreement.",

The maximum value of a vehicle that a person can retain with a DRO is also rising from \u00a32,000 to \u00a34,000 - however, the latter two changes will not be introduced until June 28.\n\nThese changes were widely welcomed by debt charities and campaigners as many claimed the \u00a390 fee prevented some of the country's most vulnerable from getting the debt help they desperately needed. According to figures from the Insolvency Service, in 2023, some 31,717 DROs were granted in England and Wales - more than at any other point in the last five years.\n\nBut what exactly is a DRO and how would the changes help if you needed one? Here we explained everything you need to know.\n\nA debt relief order is one way for people to deal with debts. The concept was introduced 15 years ago and was intended to provide a simpler and cheaper path through insolvency for the individual.\n\nIf you have a DRO, it lasts for 12 months and can freeze some, or all of your debts during this time. This means you do not need to pay them. After one year, your debts can be written off completely if your circumstances haven\u2019t changed. A DRO is only issued if it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be able to clear your debts and you meet the eligibility criteria.\n\nAccording to Citizens Advice, you can apply for a DRO if:\n\nYou have qualifying debts of less than \u00a330,000 (rising to \u00a350,000 from June 28)\n\nYou don\u2019t own things of value or have savings over \u00a32,000 (car value limit is raising to \u00a34,000 from June 28)\n\nYou have \u00a375 or less spare each month after paying your household bills\n\nYou\u2019ve lived or worked in England and Wales within the last three years\n\nThe debts you can use a Debt Relief Order for are called qualifying debts., and these include:\n\nArrears with rent\n\nUtility bills\n\nTelephone bills\n\nCouncil tax and income tax\n\nOutstanding borrowing on credit cards, loans and overdrafts\n\nBusiness debts and money owed to friends and family\n\nYou can only apply for a DRO through an approved person known as an intermediary and most free debt advice providers have approved intermediaries who can help you. It currently costs \u00a390 to get a DRO but as mentioned above, this will be scrapped from April 6. Currently, you need to pay the entire fee before your DRO is accepted.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing problem debt or are feeling stressed about money, you don\u2019t have to suffer in silence. The sooner you reach out for help and speak to someone about what you\u2019re going through, the sooner you can get your finances back on track.\n\nContact Stepchange.org for online debt advice 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, or call 0800 138 1111, Monday to Friday 8am to 8pm and Saturday 8am to 4pm.",

Here\u2019s how I\u2019d go about it, starting today.\n\nHow I\u2019d invest my first \u00a320k ISA to target \u00a34,900 a year from dividend shares\n\nThe content of this article is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to be, nor does it constitute, any form of personal advice.

Learn More .\n\nSome of the FTSE 100\u2018s dividend shares look very tasty now.\n\nThe ones I like the best are in just a few sectors though. And as a new investor, I\u2019d want diversification. But I have a way to get some of that with just three stocks.\n\nISA start\n\nIf I had \u00a320k now to start my first ISA, what would I do? First, I\u2019d open my ISA right away, before the deadline.\n\nThen I\u2019d pay in the cash\u2026 and relax. There\u2019s no deadline for actually buying shares.\n\nStill, I know the three stocks I\u2019d want today.\n\nBig dividend\n\nFirst is Phoenix Group Holdings, for its 10% dividend yield. And also because I think insurance stocks are among the best long-term FTSE 100 buys.\n\nIt can be a volatile sector, and I\u2019d expect ups and downs from this one, for sure. But Phoenix just affirmed a progressive dividend policy, so I think that makes the yield a bit safer than usual. And today\u2019s valuation seems like a good one to get in at.\n\nI see some great bank dividends out there too. But I\u2019d skip those for the sake of diversification, and save them for my next ISA allowance. Oh, that\u2019s in just a few days.\n\nCheap housing\n\nA housebuilder\u2019s a must, and they all look good to me. So I think I\u2019d go for the 6.8% dividend from Taylor Wimpey.\n\nI still expect a tough couple of years ahead, as the full effects of high inflation and interest rates could take some time to feed through.\n\nBut I\u2019d buy for the long term. And for decades, we\u2019ve had high housing demand and a supply shortage.\n\nDiversification\n\nFinally, City of London Investment Trust (LSE: CTY), which spreads its money across a range of top-quality FTSE stocks.\n\nWith one buy, I\u2019d snap up some BAE Systems, RELX, Shell, HSBC Holdings, Unilever\u2026 and they\u2019re just the investment trust\u2018s top five holdings, with plenty more.\n\nThe dividend yield\u2019s been around 5%, which isn\u2019t the biggest. But it\u2019s on the Association of Investment Companies\u2019 list of \u2018Dividend Heroes\u2019, which have raised their dividends for at least 20 years in a row.\n\nDividend rises\n\nCity of London has managed it for 57 straight years now. If it should be unable to lift the cash one year, I could see a share price slump. But the diversification must help.\n\nThe question is, how would I spread the cash? I think I\u2019d be happy with 50% of my money in City of London, with 25% in each of the others. Each investor needs to decide on their own spread.\n\nBut this allocation would get me an overall dividend yield of 6.7%.\n\nMy \u00a34,900?\n\nSo how could I get my \u00a34,900 a year? Well, a single \u00a320k ISA spread across these three stocks and held for 20 years could get me there. That\u2019s assuming 6.7% a year, reinvested, and no share price gains.\n\nAlternatively, investing just \u00a35k every year in an ISA could get me there in just over 10 years.",

      "article_text": "Binance executives sue Nigerian authorities over rights violation\n\nTwo senior executives from Binance have filed a lawsuit against against Nigeria\u2019s national security adviser\u2019s office and its anti-corruption agency, alleging violations of their fundamental rights.\n\nThe executives have petitioned the court for their release, escalating the dispute between the cryptocurrency giant and Nigerian authorities.\n\nTigran Gambaryan, an American who serves as Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, a dual citizen of the UK and Kenya and the exchange\u2019s regional manager for Africa, traveled to Nigeria in response to the country\u2019s clampdown on cryptocurrency trading platforms. Upon their arrival on February 26, they were detained.\n\nThe situation intensified when Anjarwalla left Nigeria last week and is now facing an international arrest warrant. Interestingly, his British passport, which he used to enter Nigeria, remains in the custody of Nigerian authorities. This has raised questions about how he managed to leave the country using a Kenyan passport without having any other travel documents while in detention.\n\nGambaryan, on the other hand, appeared in a Federal High Court in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital, on Thursday. He sought a declaration from Judge Iyang Ekwo that his detention and the confiscation of his passport by the National Security Adviser and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) constituted a breach of his constitutional right to personal liberty.\n\nThe executives claim they were not briefed on any specific allegations against them. Their legal demands include an order for their immediate release, the return of their passports, a public apology, and a court injunction to prevent further detention.\n\nThe hearing, however, was delayed to April 8, as attorneys representing the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and the EFCC were absent from the proceedings.\n\nThe detention of Anjarwalla and Gambaryan followed a criminal complaint received by a magistrate court in Abuja, leading to their custody since their arrival in Nigeria on February 26. The court then authorized the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to detain both individuals for 14 days, later extending this period after Binance reportedly failed to comply with a court order demanding access to data on Nigerian traders on its platform.\n\nNigeria has made a formal request to Binance demanding details on its top 100 users in the country and a comprehensive transaction history spanning the past six months.",

If this sounds familiar, Mrs Hinch fans have got three easy and cheap solutions.\n\nWhile you think bleach might be the answer, it could actually be making the stains a lot worse as one woman found out. She took to Facebook to ask fellow cleaning fans for their suggestions on how to tackle them.\n\nPosting in the Mrs Hinch Cleaning Tips and Tricks Facebook group she shared a picture of the stained toilet and wrote: \"Help! My toilet seat is stained with urine and I have tried so much to get it off but nothing has worked.\"\n\nShe then asked if it was worth just replacing the seat and asked: \"I've tried using a scourer with The Pink Stuff, baking soda and white vinegar, lemon, Viakal and bleach - you name it - they don't work. Nothing works and I feel so dirty. Has anyone got any advice or am I going to need a new toilet seat?\"\n\nOne cleaning fan advised: \"I think it's caused by bleach if you leave it on too long as I've had the same problem.\" So instead, many recommended a \"magic eraser\".\n\n\"Magic Eraser! I have just recently discovered how magical these things really are and man are they a life changer,\" one person shared, while another added: \"Try a magic sponge, I used one as a last resort and it worked perfectly.\"\n\nYou can buy magic erasers online and in supermarkets such as the Flash Magic Eraser Extra Power Cleaners cost \u00a33 from Sainsbury's for two which works out at \u00a31.50 per eraser. There is also the Elbow Grease Magic Eraser costs \u00a31.49 from B&M for three which works out at 49p per eraser.\n\nAside from a magic eraser, another cleaning fanatic suggested The Pink Stuff cleaning paste which can be used on all surfaces. To use, apply with a soft cloth or sponge, rub gently and rise with hot water. The Pink Stuff website further advised: \"Do not allow to dry. Be especially careful with glass, highly polished steel surfaces and ceramic hobs. If in doubt always test first on an inconspicuous area. Do not use it on hot or warm surfaces. Replace lid after use,\" according to The Express.\n\nOthers suggested homemade solutions, and another suggestion was a mixture of white vinegar and baking soda. One Facebook user said: \"You said you tried vinegar but use again with baking soda, leave to settle, works for me on this sort of thing,\" and echoed by another who said: \"Mix baking soda and vinegar, repeat [the] process a few times.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share?

Source: Finbold\n\nWeakening demand and lower delivery numbers speak against Tesla\n\nTesla is expected to report sluggish first-quarter deliveries next week as the impact of its price cuts fades and it faces stiff competition in a slowing electric-vehicle market.\n\nDespite years of rapid sales growth, Tesla is anticipating a slowdown in 2024, exacerbated by its slow response in updating its aging models amidst high-interest rates dampening consumer spending.\n\nDelivery estimates in China have dropped by 3% to 4% year-over-year this quarter, leading to sluggish growth and squeezed margins, particularly in China.\n\nWill Xiaomi\u2019s low prices be sustainable in the EV war?\n\nAnalysts hold differing views on Xiaomi\u2019s car project amidst the challenging landscape of the current EV industry, which has already seen casualties.\n\nWhile some view it as a natural extension for the company, given its widespread presence in Chinese homes with products like rice cookers and air purifiers, others see it as a departure from Xiaomi\u2019s image as an affordable brand.\n\nAdditionally, the launch of the car coincides with a challenging period in China\u2019s auto market, with established players continuously expanding their market share.\n\nMarket share of EV producers in China for 2023. Source: The China Project\n\nOn the positive side, Xiaomi benefits from revenue generated by its other businesses, as analysts believe that Xiaomi\u2019s expertise in smartphones gives it an advantage over traditional automakers.\n\nAnalysts aren\u2019t convinced by Tesla price cuts\n\nIn its most recent note, Deutsche Bank highlighted concerns about Tesla\u2019s margins and earnings, noting the company\u2019s recent price cuts in China and Europe to stimulate vehicle purchases. While Tesla plans to raise prices in the US and China in April, Deutsche Bank sees this as an effort to boost sales in March rather than a reflection of strong demand.\n\nThe firm also expressed apprehension about Tesla\u2019s deliveries, suggesting a potential risk to earnings for the quarter. Looking ahead to the full year, Deutsche Bank sees significant downside risk to volume and pricing expectations, which could further dampen investor sentiment and place considerable pressure on the stock.\n\nTesla appears to be facing the challenging task of fending off competition, particularly in China, while also striving to maintain profitability, which poses a precarious balancing act.\n\nBuy stocks now with eToro \u2013 trusted and advanced investment platform\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

      "article_text": "Entire swathes of Kazakhstan look like a scene from a disaster movie.\n\nVast amounts of floodwater have destroyed villages and carried away livestock. Social media is filled with images of people clambering for safety onto the roofs of their homes as rescue helicopters circle above.\n\nWhen spring arrives, Kazakhstan knows to expect runoff water from melting ice and snow, but this year has been a shock. Bridges have been destroyed, entire sections of highway are now underwater, hundreds of homes have been rendered uninhabitable, and many have been left without tap water and household gas. At least three people are believed to have lost their lives.\n\nThe floods that began earlier this month have affected at least seven regions, with the north hardest-hit. The Emergency Situations Ministry said that as of March 29, around 4,700 people, including almost 1,700 children, have been rescued and evacuated. More than 500 residential buildings are flooded. In some regions, entire government buildings, schools and hospitals are flooded.\n\nSpeaking at an emergency government meeting on March 29, Prime Minister Olzhas Bektenov described these as the largest floods in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe main thing now is to save people\u2019s lives and minimize the fallout from the disaster,\u201d Bektenov told Emergency Situations Minister Chingis Arinov, who briefed the Cabinet on mitigation measures being adopted.\n\nBektenov said an investigation would be conducted by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office into whether the scale of the crisis was compounded by negligence.\n\nThe Abai regional department of the Emergency Services Ministry reported on March 29 that a search for three men who went missing during the floods has been going on for the past week. One is believed to have fallen from his horse into a rushing river, after which he was apparently carried away by the stream. Two others tried to cross the same river on a tractor and got stuck. Divers were enlisted to search for the missing men, but that effort had to be suspended due to weather conditions.\n\nResidents of some affected areas have mounted wildcat demonstrations at what they perceive to be inadequate efforts by the authorities to handle the situation. In doing so, they have incurred sanctions.\n\nA court in the northern Akmola region on March 28 fined six residents of the village of Koyandy for participating in an unsanctioned rally. Fifty people in the village had blocked a nearby road in protest at the local authorities failing to clear snow in good time, which they said caused their homes to be flooded.\n\nAlthough spring floods occur every year, authorities are often unprepared for the costly consequences. Government critics argue that officials are pathologically incapable of learning from experience and even ignore warnings from experts about incoming floods. Officials argue in turn that the natural disasters are growing worse in scale.\n\nA particularly bitter irony is that while Kazakhstan routinely struggles with floods in March-April, the months that follow have often delivered a period of drought.\n\nKirill Pavlov, the Shymkent-based leader of a farming lobby organization, says that the government should have long ago learned how to manage meltwater.\n\n\u201cAll countries that have water shortage collect every drop of rain, every snowflake, but in our country all the water from the floods is lost. We have never learned to value water,\u201d Pavlov was quoted as saying by Radio Azattyk, the Kazakh service of RFE/RL.",

Photograph: Cyril Byrne\n\nThe Government has sought expressions of interest in a new contract for privately operated speed cameras on the national road network, worth up to \u20ac206 million.\n\nThe current contract, which is held by the GoSafe consortium was awarded in August 2015 for an initial six-year period and was worth up to \u20ac115.5 million. It has since been extended.\n\nThe Garda said the increase in cost of the new contract was related to additional hours of operation of speed vans \u2014 up from 7,500 per month during the last contract, to \u201cat least 9,000 hours\u201d per month in the forthcoming contract. In addition, the new contract is for an initial period of eight years, two longer than the current one.\n\nIn September 2023, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee announced an additional \u20ac1.2 million for GoSafe to increase monitoring hours by 20 per cent, or an extra 1,500 hours per month until the end of last year. It brought the number of GoSafe hours up to 9,000 per month.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe move followed concern that the number of road deaths, having fallen steadily from 2005 until 2021, was rising again.\n\nIn January of this year, Ms McEntee told the Oireachtas Committee on Justice that a further \u20ac3.6 million would be provided for GoSafe speed cameras, continuing the increased level of operations of 9,000 hours per month throughout 2024.\n\nThe new contract, for which a pre-tender qualification notice has been advertised, is not expected to be in place until early 2025. It is a requirement that the contract be retendered every few years.\n\nDocuments released by then minister for justice Frances Fitzgerald to Independent TD for Tipperary Mattie McGrath in 2016 showed the gross cost of the speed camera system to the exchequer since 2010 was then \u20ac87 million. A figure of \u20ac115.5 million was quoted for the next six-year contract at that time.\n\nThe cameras were earning the exchequer an estimated \u20ac7 million plus per year in fines from errant motorists back in 2016.\n\nAll contracts have so far been awarded to the GoSafe consortium. GoSafe is the operating name of Road Safety Operations Ireland. The firm\u2019s owners include Co Kerry businessman Xavier McAuliffe and a French company, Egis, who own 42 per cent each. The third owner is Redflex Holdings with 16 per cent.\n\nMr McGrath has been a consistent critic of the privatised speed camera system. He said the money would be better spent on Garda enforcement.\n\n\u201cThese vans cannot spot a car with no tax or insurance, a bald tyre or give chase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are constantly hearing that garda\u00ed can now check at the roadside if a car is insured, so we should be giving them the resources to do so\u201d, he said this week. It was \u201coffensive\u201d that \u201cso much money would not go to the Garda to do the job, he said, adding \u201cif you think what the garda\u00ed could do with the money\u201d.\n\nIn the notice published on the State\u2019s e-tenders website, interested parties are asked to pre-qualify for the tendering process by answering a \u201cpre-qualification questionnaire\u201d, which examines them on their ability to do the job.\n\nIt said the process is being run by the Office of Government Procurement on behalf of the Garda Commissioner and the estimated value of the contract is up to \u20ac206 million, excluding VAT.",

      "article_text": "As a US District Court judge sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to 25 years in prison, the judge reminded the fallen crypto leader that he voluntarily committed perjury three times during his trial. Sadly, criminal conduct is unremarkable among businessmen in the digital asset space. For years, founders of crypto projects have withheld information, lied, failed to register with appropriate regulatory agencies, or executed complicated schemes to evade regulations.\n\nCrypto perjury has a particularly long-standing tradition.\n\nPerjury is a serious crime because it is often an additional, voluntary action that criminals choose to commit after they have already committed more serious crimes. Legally defined, perjury is \u201ca false statement under oath or knowingly signing a legal document that is false or includes false statements.\u201d In other words, someone commits perjury when they intentionally lie about a material issue when legally communicating with officers of a court.\n\nThe temptation to lie is particularly strong as the day of reckoning nears in a criminal trial. As their factual and legal defenses fail, defendants wanting to lessen a prison sentence are tempted to simply lie outright. For this reason, perjury is also classified as a crime that increases recommended prison sentencing terms.\n\nThe most famous self-perjurer in the crypto industry is Craig Wright, who is famous for having not invented Bitcoin. Wright perjured himself in the presence of a US magistrate judge. Eventually, a UK High Court of Justice judge summarily humiliated his self-proclamation. According to the world\u2019s supreme copyright court, Wright does not own Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper copyright and is not Bitcoin\u2019s creator.\n\nWright\u2019s longtime financial supporter Calvin Ayre quit social media after that definitive ruling, using the excuse of a pre-planned \u201cadventure.\u201d\n\nRead more: Where in the world is Sam Trabucco? FTX victims launch manhunt\n\nOther examples of crypto perjury\n\nAnother crypto bigwig who perjured himself in court was Konstantin Ignatov of OneCoin fame. Ignatov was the brother of \u201cCryptoQueen\u201d Ruja Ignatova who led one of the largest Ponzi schemes in crypto history. Ignatov falsely told a judge that he threw away his laptop in a Las Vegas trash can. In fact, Ignatov\u2019s co-conspirator took that laptop onto safe transport outside the US. US authorities are still looking for that laptop with OneCoin data.\n\nAnother famous crypto perjury actually made it to the silver screen in Netflix\u2019s Bitconned. After committing crimes via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) called Centra Tech, co-founders Raymond Trapani and Robert Farkas pled guilty to perjury in the first degree. Both admitted to lying under oath. They committed perjury in an attempt to defend their third co-founder, Sohrab Sharma, in his criminal trial.\n\nAnother lesser-known crypto perjury case involves Frank Ahlgren III. The US Department of Justice indicted Ahlgren for not reporting capital gains from BTC transactions on three years of IRS tax returns. Because Ahlgren III signed his tax returns as true under penalty of perjury, any false statements are perjurious. His criminal case began this year and is still ongoing.\n\nFailure to disclose crypto investments on a US tax return carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, disgorgement of unpaid taxes, and fines of up to $100,000 per year. Because tens of millions of American crypto investors file IRS tax returns every year with dubious accuracy, this form of perjury might be the most pervasive type of crypto perjury.\n\nDespite its severe punishment terms and the voluntary nature of committing perjury, there is a disturbing trend of crypto criminals resorting to this last-ditch defense. Needless to say, a judge is the last person in the world that anyone wants to catch them lying. Unfortunately, for many of the world\u2019s most brazen crypto criminals, judges were able to uncover the truth.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

      "article_text": "Gantry cranes: The factory start-up 28 March 2024\n\nGH has unveiled an initiative to streamline the company\u2019s collaboration with start-ups, as Julian Champkin reports.\n\nCan innovation or new ideas come to the apparently mature gantry crane sector? In Spain, manufacturer GH has unveiled an initiative to make exactly that happen. It is called GH StartUp Factory.\n\nStart-ups tend to be small operations with a single new, and either gamechanging or destined-to-fail, idea. The GH programme aims to streamline the company\u2019s collaboration with start-ups, accelerating the integration of fresh technologies into the crane maker\u2019s products and processes.\n\nIn the company\u2019s own words, \u201cIt serves as the initial destination for startups looking to make an impact in the industrial lifting and logistics industry, providing a platform for validating solutions, gaining insights on the industry, and connecting with influential decision-makers\u201d.\n\nPreviously, start-ups would come to GH and pitch their ideas. It is the standard approach, but a passive one; now, GH actively seeks solutions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll identify problems first, then find the start-up ecosystem answer,\u201d is how Ines Puyadena, co-lead of GH StartUp Factory, explains it. The idea has been maturing in GH\u2019s mind for some time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with start-ups and external agents for several years now,\u201d says Eneko Ariznabarreta, the other co-lead. \u201cSome projects have turned out better than others, but overall, these collaborative experiences have been very positive. However, until now we didn\u2019t have a structured procedure for working with start-ups.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive or six years ago we started meeting different start-ups to make initial contact with them but we soon realised that we had to do more,\u201d adds Puyadena.\n\n\u201cOur goal with GH StartUp Factory is to reverse or turn around the way we collaborate with start-ups. Until now, they would come to us, show us their ideas and then we would see if they were a good fit for us or not. In our opinion, the process should be the other way around. So from now on, first we\u2019ll identify the problems or needs we have and then we\u2019ll go to the start-up ecosystem and look for the solution we want. With GH StartUp Factory, we are aiming to integrate and structure the collaboration with start-ups within our innovation processes.\u201d\n\nAriznabarreta picks up the story: \u201cIf a start-up comes with a good proposal, we\u2019ll obviously study it and, if it\u2019s worthwhile, we\u2019ll actively collaborate.\n\n\u201cHowever, experience has shown us that this doesn\u2019t usually happen. The work of this new unit will consist of actively searching for start-ups that have relatively mature or advanced products.\u201d\n\nThe company is not looking for experiments or off-the-wall fantasies, says Ariznabarreta: \u201cWe are looking for near-market products that we can quickly incorporate into our processes.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegarding the type of start-ups we\u2019re looking for,\u201d says Puyadena, \u201con the unit\u2019s website \u2013 ghstartupfactory.com \u2013 you can see the three areas of innovation that most interest GH: connectivity and digitisation, automation and autonomous driving, and Industry 4.0.\n\n\u201cFirst, a pilot project will be carried out \u2018at scale\u2019, so to speak. Once we\u2019ve verified that the solution provided by the start-up is valid or that we consider it to be suitable for our needs, we\u2019ll begin with its actual implementation. Our intention is for it to be an agile process, at least in this first phase of verification. Afterwards, the actual implementation of the project will take as long as it takes, but we want the previous step to be dynamic and fast, both for us and for the start-ups.\u201d\n\nPuyadena highlights the \u201cagile and fast\u201d process in contrast to large firms\u2019 typical slow decision-making, and adds: \u201cIt is essential to point out to the start-ups that we don\u2019t want to take their intellectual property away from them. The intellectual property of their product remains entirely in their hands. We are only looking for a customer-supplier partnership.\u201d\n\nThe location of the start-up doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cWe are a global company,\u201d says Ariznabarreta, \u201cand we\u2019re looking for startups with the best solutions worldwide, regardless of whether they are close to our headquarters or anywhere else.\u201d\n\nThe company has set itself the target of bringing two or three projects forward this first year and another three or four next year.\n\n\u201cWe already have a project underway to address an automation problem for an internal manufacturing process, and another focused on a digital twin for hoist production,\u201d says Ariznabarreta. \u201cGH StartUp Factory is a tool that will allow us to develop and integrate new technologies into our products and processes in a more dynamic way and faster.\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to see if other manufacturers, in this industry or others, follow the new approach.",

Some people may not realize they may be owed a refund.

      "article_text": "Indonesia plans to boost its nickel production despite falling prices resulting from ample supply that are forcing some miners to shut down mines.\n\nPer plans, battery-grade nickel production in Indonesia should increase fourfold by 2030, to 1 million tons, the Financial Times reported today, citing a senior government official from Jakarta.\n\nOutput of the sort of nickel used in stainless steel production is seen rising by 15% from the current 1.9 million tons annually, deputy coordinating minister for investment and mining Septian Hario Seto told the FT.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any reason why we should not expand production of nickel for battery materials,\u201d the official told the publication. \u201cWhat we want to achieve is price equilibrium. The responsibility for us as the biggest nickel producer is to supply enough nickel so that the EV [electric vehicle] transition can progress smoothly.\u201d\n\nIndonesia is the world\u2019s largest nickel producer and, with Chinese financial help, a growing supplier of battery-grade nickel that the EV industry needs to scale production. However, with Indonesia\u2019s continued ramp-up of production, EV sales growth slowing and the outlook losing some of its brightness, nickel prices have declined substantially over the past 12 months.\n\nThis has forced some miners to shrink their operations, with Australian miners especially vulnerable, it appears. One mining company in Australia, Wyloo Metals, is already shutting down mines while industry heavyweight BHP is considering the shutdown of some of its nickel business, after taking a hit from a massive writeoff on these operations last year.\n\nThe CEO of French miner Eramet earlier this year warned that if Indonesia stays the course of nickel production ramp-up it would wipe out most of its competitors globally.\n\n\u201cIt has really made a big part of the old traditional players structurally non-competitive for the future,\u201d Christel Bories told the FT in February. \u201cThis part of the industry will either disappear or be subsidised by governments.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

Therefore, I am writing to you today to invite you to meet to explore if an agreement can be reached and ratified in advance of this deadline. It is incumbent on us to try to find a solution as soon as possible.\"\n\nLast month, talks at the Workplace Relations Commission on the impasse ended without agreement.\n\nThe airline said at the time that IALPA representatives had sought pay increases that were significantly higher than the 12.25% increase in consolidated pay and 1.5% increase in unconsolidated pay that had been recommended by an independent pilot pay tribunal in its report in December 2023, but rejected by the pilots.\n\nIt is understood that IALPA had sought an effective increase in pay for pilots of 27%, comprised of a 20% pay increase over three years and the full cost of a 2019 crewing agreement understood to be worth a further 7%.\n\nSpeaking at the time of the publication of the company's results in February, Luis Gallego, the CEO of Aer Lingus\u2019s parent IAG, warned investment in the airline would be reduced in the absence of a pilot pay agreement.",

      "article_text": "Adam Katz (second left) co-founder of Irenic Capital Management which has increased its stake in FD Technologies. Photograph: Bloomberg\n\nA New York-based activist investor called Irenic Capital Management has doubled its stake in FD Technologies, the Newry-based tech firm which is currently undergoing major restructuring.\n\nStock exchange filings show Irenic has doubled its stake to more than 10 per cent of the shares, valued at \u20ac41.1 million at FD Technologies\u2019 current price.\n\nIrenic first took a stake in FD in January, buying up 5.8 per cent of the company\u2019s shares, having previously held no notifiable position. That stake would have been worth around \u20ac23 million at the company\u2019s then share price.\n\nIrenic is an activist hedge fund run by Adam Katz and Andy Dodge, which in its own words \u201cinvests in public companies and works collaboratively with firm leadership\u201d in order to \u201cproduce improvements in operating and financial performance that create long-term value for the company and its owners\u201d.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIn recent years Irenic has been involved at various times in high-level board discussions with the management of Capricorn Energy Plc, a London-listed natural gas producer, as well as the restaurant chain Wagamama. In 2022 the fund publicly opposed Rupert Murdoch\u2019s plans to merge Fox and NewsCorp.\n\nIn March of this year, after what it described as \u201cextensive consultation with shareholders and input from advisors\u201d, FD announced it was splitting itself into three different businesses.\n\nThe split will be based roughly around its three distinct business units. Its marketing technology division, MRP, is set to merger with a US firm called CONTENTgine, in which FD Technologies will hold a 49 per cent stake.\n\nIt will also sell off its technology and consulting arm, KX, though it noted in a stock exchange filings in March that it would \u201ctake a measured approach to the separation of KX and First Derivative, particularly with respect to the timing of any transaction, having regard to market conditions to ensure that a divestment of First Derivative reflects its value\u201d.\n\nThe value of shares in FD Technologies has fallen substantially in the last few years. In June of last year the shares were trading at more than \u20ac21, but have since fallen to a recent low of less than \u20ac12.",

The public comment period was to expire March 11 but the EPA extended it till March 26. The agency had published the proposal January 26 on the Federal Register\u2019s website.\n\nThe groups said the rule should let operators net methane emissions at the parent company level, which they say is a mechanism provided by the Clean Air Act as a form of flexibility. Instead, the EPA is proposing to calculate emissions and the applicable charge per facility.\n\n\u201cAllowing netting at the parent company level is appropriate because it would fully implement Congress\u2019s clear purpose of mitigating the impact of the fee program and incentivize emission reductions across operations under the same parent company\u201d, they said in the comment letter shared online by the API.\n\nThe groups also contested the rule proposal\u2019s interpretation of a fee exemption provided by the law for extra emissions caused by, as spelled out in the Clean Air Act, \u201cunreasonable delay, as determined by the Administrator, in environmental permitting of gathering or transmission infrastructure necessary for offtake of increased volume as a result of methane emissions mitigation implementation\u201d.\n\nThe EPA wants to only grant the exemption if neither the entity seeking the exemption nor the entity seeking the permit contributed to the delay.\n\nIn other criteria, the proposal states, \u201c[T]he exempted emissions must be those (and only those) resulting from the flaring of gas that would have been mitigated without the permit delay, and the flaring that occurs must be in compliance with all applicable local, state, and Federal regulations regarding flaring emissions\u201d.\n\nIt also specifies that \u201ca set period of months must have passed from the time a submitted permit application was determined to be complete by the applicable permitting authority\u201d.\n\nThe groups said in the comment, \u201cRather than limiting the unreasonable delay exemption by inappropriate and impractical brightline criteria, EPA should adopt a case-by-case process for determining whether an unreasonable delay in permitting has occurred\u201d.\n\n\u201cSet timelines for applicant responsiveness and unreasonable delay for permit issuance do not recognize the complexity of environmental permitting for gathering and transmission infrastructure\u201d, they added. \u201cA single pipeline project may require several environmental permits from various federal, state, and local agencies with different application procedures and review timelines\u201d.\n\nThe proposal says, \u201cThe EPA understands that the issue of what constitutes an unreasonable delay is multi-faceted and may be quite different under different factual circumstances\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the EPA believes it is important in the context of this program to propose a definition that is both consistent with the statutory charge and administrable within the capabilities of the EPA\u201d, the proposal explains.\n\nThe groups also do not want the EPA to restrict the legislation\u2019s fee exemption for permanently shut-in and plugged wells to emissions that, as stated in the proposal, \u201coccur at the well level including those from wellhead equipment leaks, liquids unloading, and workovers with and without hydraulic fracturing in the reporting year in which the well was plugged\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing to only consider these emissions sources in the calculation of exempted emissions for the permanently shut-in and plugged well as we expect use of production-related equipment or equipment associated with treating production streams generally (e.g., AGRU, dehydrator, separator) to be at a minimum\u201d, the proposal says.\n\nThe groups said, \u201cInstead, EPA should implement the alternative of allowing owners/operators to quantify the emissions reductions from other on-site sources attributable to the well closure\u201d.\n\nThe groups also want the EPA to provide a \u201cworkable timeline\u201d for reporting compliance.\n\n\u201cAlthough claiming to base the WEC Proposed Rule on a plain reading of the statutory text, EPA has in reality designed a program that countermands the plain intent of Congress and in many cases goes far beyond the enabling statute by limiting the scope of emissions netting, creating unattainable exemption criteria, and establishing an unworkable administrative timeline\u201d, reads the letter.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, API senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs Dustin Meyer, said, \u201cU.S. oil and natural gas is innovating throughout its operations to reduce methane emissions while meeting growing energy demand\u201d.\n\n\u201cYet this proposal creates an incoherent, confusing regulatory regime that will only stifle technology advancements and hamper energy development\u201d, Meyer added in the statement posted on the API website.\n\n\u201cWith partners across the industry, we will consider all options to ensure a smart regulatory framework for continued American energy development\u201d.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

      "article_text": "Pakistan\u2019s budget airline, Fly Jinnah, celebrated a milestone today with the launch of its second international route. This new service connects the bustling city of Lahore with Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe carrier launched its international operations on 18 February 2024, with the first flight connecting Islamabad and Sharjah\n\nSecond International Service\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to unveil this exciting new route, just one month after kicking off our international operations with flights from Islamabad to Sharjah,\u201d remarked a Fly Jinnah spokesperson.\n\n\u201cThis expansion strengthens air links between Pakistan and the UAE, while providing our passengers with even more affordable and convenient travel options, both domestically and internationally.\u201d\n\nFly Jinnah remains dedicated to delivering a comfortable and budget-friendly flying experience. Their modern fleet of five Airbus A320 aircraft currently connects five major Pakistani cities. These are Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, and Quetta.\n\nThe new route to Sharjah further broadens their international reach.\n\nBeyond spacious economy seating with the most generous legroom in the industry, Fly Jinnah offers a value-driven travel experience.\n\nPassengers can choose from a variety of delicious and affordable options through the onboard \u201cSkyCafe\u201d menu, featuring snacks, sandwiches, and meals.\n\nAdditionally, \u201cSkyTime\u201d provides complimentary in-flight entertainment, allowing passengers to stream a wide selection of content directly to their devices.\n\nAbout Fly Jinnah\n\nFly Jinnah is a young and dynamic airline taking to the skies of Pakistan and beyond. Established in 2021 as a joint venture between Lakson Group of Pakistan and Air Arabia Group of the United Arab Emirates, Fly Jinnah quickly carved a niche as the country\u2019s first low-cost carrier.\n\nTheir mission is simple: to provide comfortable, reliable, and affordable air travel for everyone in Pakistan. With a focus on value, Fly Jinnah offers competitive fares without compromising on passenger experience.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Aviation Industry: Soaring Potential with Room for Growth\n\nPakistan\u2019s aviation industry boasts a rich history, with Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) taking flight in 1946. Today, the sector caters to both domestic and international travel, playing a crucial role in the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThe industry is a significant job creator, directly employing tens of thousands of people in airlines, airports, and related sectors.\n\nIt also indirectly supports numerous jobs through tourism and economic activity generated by air travel. Estimates suggest the industry contributes billions of dollars to Pakistan\u2019s GDP.\n\nHowever, the Pakistani aviation sector faces challenges. Outdated infrastructure at some airports hinders efficiency and capacity.\n\nAdditionally, inconsistent regulations and a shortage of skilled aviation professionals can impede growth.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are positive signs. The government is investing in upgrading airport infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, new airlines like Fly Jinnah are emerging, offering budget-friendly travel options. Moreover, a potential privatization of PIA could revitalize the national carrier.\n\nLooking ahead, the future of Pakistan\u2019s aviation industry appears promising. The sector is characterized by continued investment in infrastructure, regulatory reforms, and the emergence of new players.\n\nAs such, it bears the potential to become a major driver of economic growth and connect Pakistan more seamlessly to the world.\n\nDid you know AviationSource has two newsletters?

      "article_text": "The cryptocurrency market is in a consolidation range after a remarkable bull rally, followed by a bearish correction. Meanwhile, the latter has favored an increased open interest in short positions for some cryptocurrencies that could short squeeze.\n\nEssentially, a short squeeze happens when a sudden price increase forces multiple opened shorts to close, liquidating the bearish traders. This event fuels the uptrend, driving prices even further.\n\nTherefore, identifying large liquidity pools to the upside could help cryptocurrency traders spot valuable opportunities in the derivatives market.\n\nFinbold gathered data from CoinGlass on March 29 and spotted a short-squeeze potential for Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nFirst, Solana\u2019s open interest has maintained historical highs in the past few weeks, following its native token\u2019s, SOL, price action. There are currently over $3 billion in Futures contracts while traders speculate on SOL\u2019s volatility.\n\nSOL Futures open interest in USD. Source: CoinGlass\n\nInterestingly, much of this interest is allocated to short positions, which has created large liquidity pools to the upside. In particular, with meaningful accumulation at $192, $194, and $197, making those potential targets in a short squeeze next week.\n\nAs of writing, SOL trades at around $185 and a run to these targets offers a possible 6.5% gain.\n\nSOL liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nOne of Solana\u2019s most promising competitors, Avalanche, is also presenting a potential short-squeeze opportunity for next week. However, AVAX\u2019s open interest is lower than $500 million, with a significantly lower capital flow than its leading competitor.\n\nAVAX Futures open interest in USD. Source: CoinGlass\n\nLike SOL, the majority of the market\u2019s interest in Avalanche seems to weigh towards short positions. In particular, creating a massive liquidation target at the $59.5 price level, with over 11.5% potential gains from $53.35 registered at the time of publication.\n\nAVAX liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass\n\nDespite the relevant potential, short-sellers futures liquidations do not guarantee a short squeeze will occur. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and drastically changes every minute with news and technical analyses.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

      "article_text": "Louis Gossett Jr., who became the first Black man to win the Oscar for best supporting actor for playing a no-nonsense drill sergeant in \u201cAn Officer and a Gentleman\u201d (1982), has died, his family said Friday.\n\nHe was 87.\n\n\"It is with our heartfelt regret to confirm our beloved father passed away this morning,\" the actor's family said in a statement. \"We would like to thank everyone for their condolences at this time. Please respect the family\u2019s privacy during this difficult time.\"\n\nIn an acting career that spanned six decades, Gossett appeared in dozens of movies and television shows, including the film adaptation of Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s \u201cA Raisin in the Sun\u201d (1961) and big-screen spectacles like \u201cThe Deep\u201d (1977).\n\nRichard Gere, left, and Louis Gossett Jr., in 'An Officer and A Gentlman'. in 1982. Paramount/Courtesy Everett Col / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nHe won an Emmy for playing the old slave Fiddler in the seminal ABC miniseries \u201cRoots\u201d (1977), acting in three of the program\u2019s eight episodes. He delivered a memorable late-career turn in HBO\u2019s \u201cWatchmen\u201d (2019), playing a former vigilante known as Hooded Justice.\n\nBut his portrayal of the tough-as-nails Gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley in \u201cAn Officer and a Gentleman,\u201d a romantic drama co-starring Richard Gere and Debra Winger, cemented him deepest in the public consciousness.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a love-hate relationship between the sergeant and his trainees,\u201d Roger Ebert wrote in his review. \u201cLou Gossett Jr. does such a fine job of fine-tuning the line between his professional standards and his personal emotions that the performance deserves its Academy Award.\u201d\n\nGossett\u2019s triumph at the 55th Academy Awards in 1983 made him only the second Black man to win an acting Oscar, 19 years after Sidney Poitier won for his leading role in \u201cLilies of the Field.\u201d\n\nLouis Gossett Jr. was born May 27, 1936, in Brooklyn, New York. He was drawn to athletics as a kid, especially basketball, but an injury kept him from playing for a time and led him to another pursuit: stage acting.\n\nWhen he was in high school, a teacher encouraged him to try out for a play \u2014 and that audition resulted in his Broadway debut in the 1953 production of \u201cTake a Giant Step,\u201d a coming-of-age tale about a Black teenager growing up in a predominantly white community.\n\nHe graduated from high school a year later and then enrolled at New York University. He continued to pick up acting gigs along the way, including a role in the Broadway version of \u201cThe Desk Set,\u201d as well as small parts on television shows.\n\nGossett\u2019s most notable stage credit was in the original cast of \u201cA Raisin in the Sun,\u201d a classic play about a Black family searching for a better life. Gossett portrayed the wealthy and pretentious George Murchison, a role he reprised in the 1961 movie version directed by Daniel Petrie.\n\nHe continued to act in Broadway and off-Broadway productions during the 1960s. He made his second major film appearance in Hal Ashby\u2019s dark comedy \u201cThe Landlord,\u201d released in 1970. The same year, he co-starred on the short-lived TV series \u201cThe Young Rebels.\u201d\n\nGossett landed roles in several lesser-known movies during the early \u201870s, including \u201cSkin Game\u201d (1971), George Cukor\u2019s \u201cTravels With My Aunt\u201d (1972) and \u201cThe Laughing Policeman\u201d (1973). He played a drug kingpin in \u201cThe Deep,\u201d adapted from a novel by \u201cJaws\u201d author Peter Benchley.\n\n\u201cRoots,\u201d a sweeping chronicle of the evils of slavery, raised Gossett\u2019s profile, landing him an Emmy in September 1977. Gossett\u2019s fellow nominees in his category were all members of the \u201cRoots\u201d ensemble: John Amos, LeVar Burton and Ben Vereen. (The series itself claimed six awards, including best limited series.)\n\nGossett reprised the role of Fiddler in the 1988 television movie \u201cRoots: The Gift.\u201d\n\nLouis Gossett Jr. and LeVar Burton in \"Roots.\" ABC Photo Archives / Getty Images\n\n\u201cAn Officer and a Gentleman\u201d propelled Gossett to national acclaim. He underwent rigorous training for the role, spending 10 days at a school for drill instructors at Camp Pendleton in California, where he marched, ran and practiced karate from 4:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day.\n\nHe was thrilled to receive an Oscar nomination, but he was convinced the supporting actor prize would go to industry veterans Robert Preston (\u201cVictor/Victoria\u201d) or James Mason (\u201cThe Verdict\u201d).\n\nWhen presenters Christopher Reeve and Susan Sarandon called his name from the stage of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, Gossett\u2019s agent jabbed him in the chest, the actor recalled in 2018. \u201cThey said your name,\u201d the agent said.\n\n\u201cI got up as smooth as I possibly could, trying to figure out what I was going to say,\u201d Gossett recalled in an interview with the Television Academy.\n\nGossett was disappointed that bigger film parts did not follow his Oscar victory.\n\n\u201cI was left with a lot of time on my hands\u201d after the Academy Award, Gossett told The New York Times in 1989. \u201cI thought I\u2019d get a lot of offers \u2014 and they didn\u2019t come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI let myself become bitter, resentful,\u201d he added. \u201cI was my own worst enemy. I said to myself, \u2018What more can I do? Where\u2019s the light at the end of the tunnel?\u2019 I started to self-destruct.\u201d\n\nHe started to abuse alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. \u201cI had an Oscar, an Emmy, and yet I had this big hole in my soul,\u201d Gossett told the Times.\n\nEventually, Gossett entered a residential drug-treatment program in Los Angeles and stopped using drugs, according to the profile in the Times. The path to sobriety was \u201cvery humbling and necessary, a very positive time,\u201d he said.\n\nGossett was a ubiquitous and dependable presence on the big and small screens for decades to come \u2014 quietly commanding, sometimes intimidating, sometimes soulful.\n\nHe acted in genre-spanning films such as \u201cJaws 3-D\u201d (1983), \u201cEnemy Mine\u201d (1985), \u201cThe Principal\u201d (1987), \u201cThe Punisher\u201d (1989), \u201cToy Soldiers\u201d (1991), \u201cDiggstown\u201d (1992), \u201cBlue Chips\u201d (1994) and a string of under-the-radar indie movies from 2000-2010.\n\nHe frequently cropped up on television, guest-starring on episodes of \u201cTouched by an Angel,\u201d \u201cER,\u201d \u201cPsych,\u201d \u201cBoardwalk Empire.\u201d He recently played a small but pivotal role as a legendary attorney accused of sexual misconduct on the Paramount+ series \u201cThe Good Fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatchmen,\u201d Damon Lindelof\u2019s celebrated limited series based on the landmark DC Comics series of the same name, gave Gossett one of his most distinctive late-period roles. He was the enigmatic Will Reeves, grandfather of the show\u2019s hero, Angela Abar, played by Regina King.\n\nGossett's final run of roles included Ol' Mister Johnson in the 2023 film musical version of \"The Color Purple\" and a voice part in the John Krasinski-directed fantasy \"IF,\" scheduled for release in May.",

      "article_text": "Blog\n\nWhen a policy that would save billions doesn't create more spending headroom, our fiscal rules aren't fit for purpose\n\nGordon Brown has said the UK needs to get out of its \u200b\u201cdoom loop of poverty\u201d. In doing so, he has endorsed a proposal from us at NEF to change the way the Treasury currently subsidises the Bank of England\u2019s interest payments to the banking sector. He\u2019s right that the Treasury could make billions from changing these interest payments \u2013 but the problem is, it could have no impact at all on how much the government lets itself spend. These savings might not be a magic wand for the country\u2019s economic woes if we stay ruled by our arbitrary debt and borrowing restrictions (known as \u200b\u201cfiscal rules\u201d) . Here\u2019s why.\n\n\n\nPrivate banks hold reserves at the central bank, and the central bank pays interest to the private banking sector for holding them. These interest payments began when quantitative easing flooded the banking system with excess reserves in the aftermath of the 2008/\u200b09 financial crisis. The level of interest paid on these reserves is determined by central bank interest rates, which are raised or lowered in order to shape the economy using monetary policy.\n\nHowever, as we have argued since 2022, paying interest on all reserves is not necessary for monetary policy to have its desired impact on the wider economy \u2013 and it was not central bank policy before 2009. Instead, by requiring banks to hold some reserves that pay zero interest and only paying interest on reserves in an excess tier, central banks can save money. Since September 2023, the European Central Bank (ECB) stopped paying interest on required reserves which, they say, \u200b\u201cimproves the efficiency of monetary policy\u201d.\n\nWhile the ECB has changed, the Bank of England continues to pay interest on all reserves. We calculated tiering reserves could save the Bank between \u00a31.3 \u2013 11.5bn a year. The range of estimates depend on the level of reserve requirements. A 1% reserve requirement, equal to the ECB\u2019s, would save \u00a31.3bn; a 2.5% reserve requirement, equal to the Swiss National Bank\u200b\u2019s, would save \u00a33.3bn; and a 10% reserve requirement, lower than the requirements the UK had in the 1970s, would save \u00a311.5bn.\n\nDue to an indemnity between the Bank of England and the Treasury, the Treasury has effectively been funding the interest on reserves. Therefore, tiered reserves wouldn\u2019t just be saving money for the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy operations but taxpayers too. As Gordon Brown argues, the money saved could be spent on reducing child poverty. With higher reserve requirements, it could also help fund mass insulation of our draughty, damp homes, keeping households warm, energy bills affordable, and carbon emissions down.\n\nHowever, as the chancellor has obsessed over in the past few budgets, spending decisions are subject to our \u200b\u201cfiscal headroom\u201d \u2013 meaning the amount the chancellor can borrow before breaking our fiscal rules. This headroom is based on the fiscal rules set by the government itself, which require the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to forecast that debt will be falling in 5 years\u2019 time. Importantly, falling here doesn\u2019t mean debt being lower than it is now, just lower than it is in 4 years\u2019 time. Therefore, making a fixed saving of billions of pounds every year, starting in the first year of the forecast, could make no difference to the fiscal headroom. It wouldn\u2019t change the amount by which government debt falls between the 4th and 5th year of the forecast and therefore wouldn\u2019t show up as extra headroom for government spending. Think this sounds ridiculous? It\u2019s because our fiscal rules are.\n\n\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean politicians couldn\u2019t spend the money the Treasury saves \u2013 in fact, headroom would come out the same whether they spent this saving or not. But the point is it reflects how such a blunt metric is not adequate to assess the UK\u2019s ability to spend and borrow. When such metric receives countless speculation and media coverage, we should hold it to a higher standard than for it to fail to account for a yearly saving. It\u2019s partly why many have come out to say our fiscal rules are fundamentally flawed.\n\nNot only does this headroom not grow when the Treasury makes savings, it also is modelled as immovable even when government investment could change our outcomes. The OBR, who conduct the UK\u2019s fiscal forecast, have modelling assumptions that assume by default fiscal policy has no effect after five years, meaning any increase in government spending does not affect the economic output forecast after five years. It is no wonder then that the UK has an underinvestment problem when our economic forecaster shows negligible effects from cutting investment and the Treasury cuts investment budgets to meet fiscal rules. As shown in the OBR\u2019s latest forecast, public investment will flatline in the next five years.\n\n\n\nBoth the Conservatives and Labour see fiscal rules as sacrosanct. Jeremy Hunt has fixated on fiscal headroom despite criticism and Rachel Reeves has announced Labour won\u2019t be too different. Meanwhile, our US peers have seen a globally exceptional recovery from the pandemic, likely spurred by its pandemic stimulus and Inflation Reduction Act. Rather than force debt and borrowing down, the US is expected to continue to increase borrowing while its economy recovers. This has funded an expansive green industrial strategy that is already seeing results in mitigating dangerous carbon emissions.\n\n\n\nRachel Reeves is right to identify the success of the US\u2019s economic recovery as something the UK government should follow. But her \u200b\u201cBidenomics on a budget\u201d is setting Labour up to fail. Without the funds necessary to unlock investment, the UK will continue to stagnate, the cost of living will continue to bite, and our people and planet will continue to suffer from the effects of the climate crisis. The UK needs more investment, not more fiscal restraint, and its our fiscal rules that are holding us back.\n\n\n\nImage: iStock",

While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) endeavors to turn higher near its 50 neutral mark, the stochastic oscillator has initiated a new negative cycle, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has descended below its red signal line, indicating a lingering bearish sentiment.\n\nHowever, should the 20-day SMA maintain its support, a reversal towards the upside could see USDCAD revisiting the psychological level of 1.3600.

      "article_text": "Despite the downturn in the cryptocurrency market, FLOKI (FLOKI) and Pepe (PEPE) have begun to show promising signs of recovery. FLOKI, known for its resilience and community support, surged by an impressive 17%, indicating renewed investor interest and confidence. Similarly, Pepe (PEPE) experienced a notable increase of 6%, demonstrating its ability to weather market volatility and attract buying pressure. Amidst these encouraging developments, Furrever Token (FURR) emerges as a standout contender, aiming to capitalize on the growing momentum and offer investors the opportunity for substantial returns of up to 15X. As the market landscape evolves, these tokens present diverse opportunities for investors seeking lucrative ventures in the crypto space.\n\nFLOKI (FLOKI) Surges Over 17%: Can It Sustain Momentum Amidst Bitcoin and Ethereum Rally?\n\nFLOKI (FLOKI), currently priced at around $0.0002649, has experienced an impressive surge of over 17% within a 24-hour period, marking a substantial increase of more than 25% since last week. While the extent to which FLOKI can maintain this momentum remains uncertain, analysts are optimistic about its potential for further growth, especially if Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to bolster their upward momentum. The recent surge in FLOKI\u2019s price underscores the coin\u2019s resilience and ability to attract investor interest amidst market fluctuations.\n\nAs investors closely monitor the performance of leading cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, any sustained upward movement in these assets could provide additional tailwinds for FLOKI, potentially fueling further gains. However, given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, FLOKI\u2019s price trajectory in the near term will likely be influenced by a combination of market sentiment, external factors, and developments within the broader crypto ecosystem.\n\nPepe (PEPE): Demonstrating Resilience with a 185% Surge in One Month\n\nDespite a tumultuous week, Pepe (PEPE) maintains its resilience in the crypto market. Currently priced at around $0.000008035, it has seen a 5% increase since yesterday, showcasing its ability to withstand market volatility. Remarkably, Pepe has surged by an impressive 185% compared to its value last month, reflecting strong bullish sentiment among investors. This significant surge underscores the enduring appeal of Pepe despite the challenges faced by the broader market.\n\nThe recent uptrend in Pepe\u2019s price signals renewed investor interest and confidence in the project. Despite facing market turbulence, Pepe has demonstrated its ability to weather the storm and emerge stronger. With its remarkable performance over the past month, Pepe has captured the attention of traders seeking opportunities for substantial returns.\n\nLooking ahead, the trajectory of Pepe\u2019s price movement remains closely linked to the performance of leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Should BTC and ETH sustain their upward momentum, Pepe stands poised to capitalize on the bullish market sentiment and potentially achieve further gains.\n\nAs investors navigate through market uncertainties, Pepe\u2019s resilience and upward momentum offer a glimmer of hope, suggesting that the project has the potential to deliver favorable returns in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Is Poised to Shine as the Next Big Thing on BSC\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) has emerged as a potential game-changer on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) following its impressive performance and ambitious roadmap. Currently priced at $0.000396, FURR has captured the attention of investors with its promising features and innovative approach. One of its standout achievements is its highly successful presale, which amassed over $500,000 in funds in less than a month. This remarkable achievement underscores the strong demand and investor confidence in the project.\n\nWhat sets Furrever Token apart is its lucrative offering of up to 15X returns, enticing traders seeking substantial gains. With the presale already halfway completed in record time, FURR is positioned as a frontrunner in the BSC ecosystem. Its unique features, including the integration of cute cat-themed stickers and visuals, have resonated with users, creating a sense of community and shared enthusiasm.\n\nMoreover, FURR\u2019s commitment to security and compliance is evident through its smart contract auditing process and the team\u2019s decision to lock their tokens for a year, ensuring project longevity and stability. The project\u2019s organic growth and active engagement on platforms like Telegram further contribute to its credibility and appeal among investors.\n\nAs FURR aims to capitalize on the success of projects like Pepe (PEPE) on BSC, its potential for exponential growth and mainstream adoption is becoming increasingly evident. With a clear vision, solid fundamentals, and a passionate community backing its development, Furrever Token is poised to make waves in the ever-expanding world of cryptocurrency.\n\n<\n\nLearn more about Furrever Token:\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account",

      "article_text": "A single trader on the Solana blockchain struck gold, turning a $35,000 investment into an unrealized profit exceeding $10 million in less than two hours. This incredible feat was achieved by purchasing a newly launched meme coin called \u201ccat in a dogs world\u201d (MEW).\n\nThe daring gamble involved the trader, identified by his Solana account address \u20185We8d\u2026qP5GY\u2019, acquiring 4.41 billion MEW tokens. The initial investment of 178.2 SOL (worth approximately $35,000) was made on March 26 at 5:23 am (UTC). News of this astonishing move was reported in a tweet by Lookonchain.\n\nCrazy! \ud83d\ude31 This guy turned $35K into $8.9M in less than 2 hours! He spent 178.2 $SOL($35K) to buy 4.41B $MEW ~2 hours ago. And the 4.41B $MEW is worth $8.9M now, with an unrealized profit of ~$8.89M and a gain of 255x!https://t.co/5X0iok8J9b pic.twitter.com/vdpwKBlOUh \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 26, 2024\n\nPrice Surge and Liquidity Concerns\n\nThe trader\u2019s bold bet paid off handsomely as the price of MEW skyrocketed and the trader \u201cmade an unrealized profit of ~$8.89M and a gain of 255x!\u201d according to Lookonchain. However, a major challenge arises, and its liquidity.\n\nWith a 24-hour trading volume of over 200 million dollars, attempting to sell such a large position could prove problematic. Any significant sell-off can crash the price of MEW, potentially wiping out the trader\u2019s extraordinary gains.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, MEW currently trades at $0.002414, representing a substantial increase from the purchase price of $0.002023. This surge has pushed the market capitalization of MEW to over $203,782,622\n\nBackground of MEW\n\nVery little is currently known about the \u201ccat in a dogs world\u201d (MEW) project. Meme coins often emerge with minimal information about their creators or underlying purpose.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to be aware that these projects can be highly speculative and may lack long-term viability.

      "article_text": "Innovation is tough at the best of times. With the cost of living crisis adding extra pressure and driving many consumers to trade down to supermarket own labels, it\u2019s never been more important to get product development right. And there is a new threat for established brands in the form of disruptive innovation from an unlikely source.\n\nThe creator economy refers to personality-led, digitally-enabled value creation that arises from an individual monetising their relationship with their audience across diverse media. Or \u2018famous people selling stuff to their fans\u2019.\n\nBut unlike more traditional celebrity endorsement of big-brand products, the creator economy is driven by influencers and content creators who have built audiences independently on social media.\n\nWhy is this a threat?\n\nInfluencers and content creators who have successfully monetised their audiences via content and merchandising are now moving into fmcg spaces, with enviable returns. For example, YouTuber MrBeast\u2019s Feastables chocolate bars reportedly made over $10m in revenues in the first few months, and YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI made $1.2bn in sales in year two with their Prime Hydration drinks.\n\nThis sort of market disruption could be seen as alarming, or dismissed as niche. But I believe established brands can learn from the creator economy and adopt their own methods to power up innovation in three key ways.\n\nIntense relationships\n\nInfluencers and creators build brand desirability through the intensity of their relationships with audiences, which involve continual two-way communication and interaction. The individual creator or creator team may be talking to millions of people, but to the teenage boy in his bedroom, it feels personal.\n\nThere is an opportunity for brands to be more creative and focus on comms that create a dialogue, feel personal and bring audiences into a relationship that is fun to be part of. This requires a razor-sharp focus on exactly who that audience is.\n\nReimagined product universe\n\nGen Z consumers and upcoming gen alphas spend the most time watching online content creators. Their opinions and preferences are less likely to be formed from a trip to the supermarket or broadcast media, but instead from a curated set of influences that is unique to each of them and relates to their passions, and the algorithms.\n\nHowever, although the media landscape is profoundly different, there are still those moments of truth that are formative in people\u2019s relationships with brands \u2013 moments such as leaving home, becoming a parent, or entering into a relationship. Brands that understand how those trigger points work can ensure they are visible and building dialogue in a variety of media at those points, and build lifetime relationships by getting into those new product universes early on.\n\nExperimentation culture\n\nInfluencers and creators have an inherently disruptive experimental culture and act on instinct, testing and learning to see what works. And they fail fast. MrBeast took MrBeast Burgers from zero to \u00a3100m in sales and back down to nothing in less than two years. This agility is enabled by the speed and quality of their feedback loops.\n\nBrands need to look at innovation culture in their own organisations and emulate this agility by, for example, looking to devolve decision-making, empowering innovators to be more entrepreneurial, and considering more flexible routes to market and smaller-scale launch models.\n\nWe can\u2019t all be MrBeast, but established brands can thrive in the creator economy by learning from the best and most successful.",

Windsor Advantage has an outsourced US Small Business Administration (SBA) 7(a) and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) lending platform.\n\nCapital Bancorp, the parent entity of Capital Bank, reported assets of approximately $2.2bn as of 31 December 2023. The company operates bank branches across four locations within the greater Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland markets.\n\nAccording to Capital Bancorp, the transaction will establish a leading nationwide lender specialising in government-guaranteed lending, encompassing both USDA and US SBA programmes.\n\nFurthermore, with the addition of Windsor Advantage\u2019s government-guaranteed servicing platform, Capital Bancorp anticipates being strongly positioned to leverage and capitalise on the expanding niche market.\n\nCapital Bank CEO Ed Barry said: \u201cCapital has a track record of creating value by investing in teams and lines of businesses that generate strong returns for shareholders. This acquisition represents a continuation of our strategy to build a highly diversified business that generates best-in-class returns for our shareholders and allows us to better serve our customers.\n\n\u201cIFH\u2019s expertise originating and servicing USDA and SBA loans fits well with our strategic objectives and will allow us to serve a market with substantial need and growth potential.\u201d\n\nAccording to the merger agreement terms, Integrated Financial shareholders will trade each of their company shares for $5.36 in cash and 1.115 shares of Capital Bancorp.\n\nFollowing the closure, Capital Bancorp shareholders will hold roughly 84% ownership, while Integrated Financial shareholders will possess around 16% ownership of the merged entity.\n\nJust before or during the closing, Integrated Financial is anticipated to disburse its minority equity stake in Dogwood State Bank to its shareholders via a dividend. This amounts to approximately 0.469 Dogwood State Bank shares for each Integrated Financial common stock share.\n\nIntegrated Financial chairman, president, and CEO Marc McConnell said: \u201cWe are excited for this partnership with Capital and for the benefits that it brings to both banks.\n\n\u201cWith a larger balance sheet and our combined lending and deposit-gathering capabilities we believe that we can secure and grow our position as a leader in nationwide government guaranteed lending.\u201d\n\nThe deal has received unanimous approval from the bank holding firms\u2019 boards of directors. It is anticipated to finalise in the latter half of 2024, pending approval from the two parties\u2019 shareholders, regulatory clearances, and the fulfilment of other standard closing prerequisites.\n\nStephens acted as the financial adviser, and Squire Patton Boggs (US) served as the legal adviser to Capital Bancorp.

Two men were seriously injured in an attack on the northbound platform.\n\nThe incident is not believed to be linked to the Beckenham Junction stabbing, British Transport Police said.\n\nOfficers were called to the scene of the second incident at around 10.37pm on Wednesday, following reports of a member of the public being stabbed.\n\nThe suspect fled the scene before police arrived.\n\nSenior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Paul Attwell said: \u201cWe understand that people will be worried by this senseless attack.\n\n\"Our teams have been working throughout the night, aided by CCTV footage, forensics and detailed accounts from witnesses at the scene.\n\n\"We believe that one of the victims was injured after bravely stepping in to try to prevent the attack.\n\n\"If you have information that could help us, we urge you to contact BTP by texting 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40, quoting reference 728 of 27 March.\n\n\"Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.\u201d",

Sir Jeffrey, who has had an almost 40-year career in politics, became DUP leader in July 2021.\n\nHis career started with the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and in 1985, aged 22, he was the youngest person to be elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The 61-year-old\u2019s relationship with former UUP leader David Trimble deteriorated when he led a walkout of the 1998 peace talks after opposing the early release of republican and loyalist prisoners.\n\nHe left the party and joined the DUP in January 2004. He was recognised by the Queen in her 2016 Birthday Honours and was given a knighthood.",

Credit: PA\n\nHowever, Ms Dodds did not rule out Labour donors receiving honours should Sir Keir Starmer's party win the general election later this year.\n\nSenior No 10 sources pointed to Sir Mohamed\u2019s charitable work and record of public service, including support for The Prince\u2019s Foundation \u2013 now The King\u2019s Foundation \u2013 and a major contributor to St Paul\u2019s Cathedral\u2019s Remember Me project, which raised money for a physical memorial to those who died of Covid-19 in the UK. However, Ms Dodds said the public would \u201cmake their own minds up\u201d on whether that was the true reason behind his knighthood.Upon hearing the announcement on Friday, she said: \u201cThis is either the arrogant act of an entitled man who\u2019s stopped caring what the public thinks, or the demob-happy self-indulgence of someone who doesn\u2019t expect to be prime minister much longer.\n\n\u201cEither way, it shows a blatant disrespect for the office he should feel privileged to hold.\u201d\n\nMs Dodds says Labour has learned from the cash-for-honours controversy under Tony Blair, who was questioned three times as part of a police probe into the alleged sale of peerages in 2006. The timing of the announcement has raised eyebrows \u2013 although sources said it was linked to the need to make appointments to the Privy Council, including the new First Minister of Wales Vaughan Gething. Other recipients of honours included Philip Davies \u2013 whose wife is the government\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d minister Esther McVey \u2013 who has been knighted for public and parliamentary service. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch, who led a review of football governance in the wake of proposals for a breakaway European Super League, was given a damehood for public and parliamentary service. Farming minister Mark Spencer was given a knighthood, while Treasury Select Committee chairwoman Harriett Baldwin became a dame.

      "article_text": "Sunak and Farage during an ITV election debate in December 2019. Photograph: Matt Frost/ITV/EPA\n\nLabour has called on Rishi Sunak to rule out the mooted idea of appointing Nigel Farage as ambassador to Washington in return for him not standing in the general election, saying this could imperil international unity against Vladimir Putin.\n\nFarage has previously said the west should consider negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, and is a noted supporter of Donald Trump, who has argued the same.\n\nSome Conservative MPs are calling for Farage to be given the US post if he agrees not to play any role with Reform UK in the general election, according to reports.\n\nWhile he founded the successor to the Brexit party, Farage has a limited day-to-day role. However, many Tories fear that if he returned to frontline campaigning, he could push the party higher in the polls, compounding an expected general election defeat for the Conservatives.\n\nHe has yet to say what he will do at the election, but there has been speculation he could stand in the Tory-held seat of Clacton, which formerly had an MP from Ukip, when it was led by Farage.\n\nIn a Sky News interview on Thursday, Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, declined to rule out the idea of a deal with Farage. Asked several times if he could be made Washington ambassador, Holden told Sky News: \u201cWhat Nigel Farage does, and the Reform party, is totally up to them,\u201d adding: \u201cAll I would say is, it\u2019s irrelevant to what people are talking about on the ground.\u201d\n\nJonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general, said: \u201cRishi Sunak\u2019s weakness leaves him pandering to the extremists in his party. Rishi Sunak must put national interest before the Conservative party. No secret negotiations to keep the Farage wolf from the Tory door. Rishi Sunak must rule out this dangerous and desperate deal that risks threatening international unity against Russian aggression and undermining vital support for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf the prime minister refuses to publicly rule out such a desperate deal, it will be clearer than ever that Rishi Sunak is too weak to act in the national interest.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nA series of recent polls have put Reform, led by Richard Tice, at 10% or above, with a YouGov survey putting them at 16%, only five points behind the Conservatives.\n\nReform has scored at 10% or above in some recent byelections, a performance that makes it unlikely it will secure an MP in the general election \u2013 with the potential exception of Farage \u2013 but sufficient to take enough votes from the Conservatives that they could lose more seats to other parties.\n\nBefore the 2019 election, the Brexit party stood aside in Tory-held seats, notably helping Boris Johnson.\n\nDowning Street has been approached for comment.",

And we will never stop working to bring you home,\u201d Biden\u2019s statement said.\n\n\u2018Using Americans as pawns\u2019\n\nThis week, Russia extended Gershkovich\u2019s pre-trial detention by three months until June 30 as he awaits trial on espionage charges.\n\nThe US embassy slammed the decision and accused Russia of \u201cusing American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends\u201d.\n\nThe US ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, reiterated at Tuesday\u2019s court hearing that \u201cthe accusations against Evan are categorically untrue\u201d, calling them \u201cfiction\u201d.\n\nThere is \u201cno justification for Evan\u2019s continued detention and no explanation as to why Evan doing his job as a journalist constituted a crime,\u201d Tracy said.\n\nAnalysts suggested Moscow could be using jailed US citizens as bargaining chips as US-Russian tensions soar over the Kremlin\u2019s war in Ukraine. Gershkovich\u2019s arrest has also been criticised for its effect on other journalists working in Russia.\n\nAt least two US citizens arrested in Russia in recent years \u2013 including WNBA star Brittney Griner \u2013 have been exchanged for Russians jailed in the US. The US attempted to include 52-year-old Whelan in a prisoner exchange in 2022, but those plans fell through.\n\nGershkovich is the first US reporter to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since September 1986 when Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for US News and World Report, was arrested by the KGB.\n\nDaniloff was released without charge 20 days later in a swap for an employee of the Soviet Union\u2019s United Nations mission who was arrested by the FBI, also on spying charges.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Gershkovich could be released at some point in exchange for a Russian prisoner held abroad, but no such deal has so far materialised.",

Here, ITV News' Charlie Frost reports on the efforts to secure his release\n\nOn the one-year anniversary of the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Joe Biden said the US is working \"every day\" to secure his release from Russia. \u201cJournalism is not a crime, and Evan went to Russia to do his job as a reporter \u2014 risking his safety to shine the light of truth on Russia\u2019s brutal aggression against Ukraine,\u201d the president said today. Mr Gershkovich was arrested while on a reporting trip to the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg.\n\nRussia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleges he was acting on US orders to collect state secrets, but provided no evidence to support the accusation.\n\nHe, the Journal and the US government deny the claim, and Washington has designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nOn Friday, there was a giant blank space on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, with an image at the top of the page of Mr Gershkovich in the newspaper's signature pencil drawing and a headline that read: \u201cHis Story Should be Here.\u201d\n\nA recent court hearing offered little new information on Mr Gershkovich's case. He was ordered to remain behind bars pending trial at least until June 30, the fifth extension of his detention. But the periodic court hearings at least give Mr Gershkovich\u2019s family and friends and US officials a glimpse of him. For the 32-year-old journalist, it\u2019s a break from his otherwise largely monotonous prison routine. In a statement, Mr Biden said: \u201cWe will continue working every day to secure his release. We will continue to denounce and impose costs for Russia\u2019s appalling attempts to use Americans as bargaining chips.\n\n\"And we will continue to stand strong against all those who seek to attack the press or target journalists \u2014 the pillars of free society.\" Biden said that the US was working to free all Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. Another American accused of espionage is Paul Whelan, a corporate executive from Michigan. He was arrested in 2018 in Russia and sentenced two years later to 16 years in prison.\n\nMr Whelan, who said he traveled to Moscow to attend a friend\u2019s wedding, has maintained his innocence and said the charges against him were fabricated.\n\nWant a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?

Around 1.5 million people are sheltering in Rafah, the only city in the tiny enclave which has not been invaded by Israeli troops and serves as a vital humanitarian artery.\n\nBiden took the opportunity to address the ongoing war in Gaza, as UN agencies warn the beleaguered population is facing famine and disease outbreaks.\n\n\"We must get more food, medicine and supplies for the Palestinians, but we cannot forget that Israel is in a situation where its very existence is at stake,\" Biden told the audience.\n\nActivist organisation Jewish Voice for Peace NYC posted on social media,\"Palestinian youth, descendants of Holocaust survivors, climate activists, doctors and academics, and students disrupt one of the biggest fundraisers in the history of the Democrat Party\".\n\nSeveral demonstrators who stood up and disrupted the speeches were taken out by security as Biden spoke of the war and current negotiations with Israel.\n\n\"I have worked with the Saudis and with all the other Arab countries, including Egypt, Jordan and Qatar. They are ready to fully recognize Israel, but first there must be a plan for the 'day after' in Gaza, and there must be a way forward for a two-state solution,\" he said.\n\nThe star-studded event saw singers Queen Latifah and Lizzo perform before the presidential trio were interviewed by American comedian Stephen Colbert.\n\nBiden's campaign team said the \"record\" collection of more than $25 million was more than Republican rival Donald Trump had raised for the whole of February.\n\nAccording to reports, tickets for the event cost between $250 and $500,000, with more than 5,000 people expected to attend. Guests at the event could pay $100,000 for a photo with the trio, American network ABC News reported.\n\nTrump's campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, blasted the event on social network X, as a \"glitzy fundraiser ... with their elitist, out-of-touch celebrity benefactors\".",

      "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: U.S. President Joe Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton participate in a discussion moderated by Stephen Colbert, at Radio City Music Hall in New York, on March 28.Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters\n\nBarack Obama, Bill Clinton and some big names from the entertainment world teamed up Thursday night to deliver a rousing New York embrace of President Joe Biden that hauled in a record-setting $26 million-plus for his re-election campaign.\n\nThe mood at Radio City Music Hall was electric as Obama praised Biden\u2019s willingness to look for common ground and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of president I want.\u201d Clinton said simply of the choices facing voters in 2024: \u201cStay with what works.\u201d\n\nBiden himself went straight at Donald Trump, saying his expected GOP rival\u2019s ideas were \u201ca little old and out of shape.\u201d\n\nModerator Stephen Colbert, in an armchair conversation with the trio, called them \u201cchampion talkers\u201d and joked that the three presidents had come to town \u201cand not one of them is here to appear in court,\u201d a dig at Trump\u2019s many legal troubles.\n\nThe eye-popping fundraising haul was a major show of Democratic support for Biden at a time of persistently low poll numbers. The president will test the power of his campaign cash as he faces off with Trump, who proved with his 2016 win over Democrat Hillary Clinton that he didn\u2019t need to raise the most money to seize the presidency.\n\nDuring the nearly hour-long conversation, Obama and Clinton explained just how hard Biden\u2019s job is. They spoke of loneliness and frustration over policies that work but aren\u2019t immediately felt by the public. They gave an insider\u2019s view of the office as they sought to explain why Biden was best for the job.\n\n\u201cIt is a lonely seat,\u201d said Obama, who had hitched a ride to New York on Air Force One with Biden.\n\nThe talk was by turns humorous and serious, ending with all three donning sunglasses in the mostly dark music hall, a nod to the trademark Ray-Ban sunglasses that Biden often wears.\n\nThe sold-out Radio City Music Hall event was a gilded exclamation mark on a recent burst of campaign travel by Biden, who has visited several political battlegrounds in the three weeks since his State of the Union address served as a rallying cry for his re-election bid. Thursday\u2019s event also brought together more than three decades of Democratic leadership.\n\nThe music hall\u2019s marquee advertised the big-dollar night as \u201cAn Evening with Joe Biden Barack Obama Bill Clinton.\u201d NYPD officers lined surrounding streets as part of a heavy security presence.\n\nProtesters angry at Biden\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza and strong support of Israel briefly disrupted the show, drawing a pledge from Biden to keep working to stop civilian deaths, particularly of children. But he added, \u201cIsrael\u2019s existence is at stake.\u201d Hundreds more protested outside in the drizzling rain, many demanding a ceasefire and waving Palestinian flags.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was up first to warm up the crowd of about 5,000 supporters. Entertainers, too, lined up to make the case for Biden. Lizzo belted out her hit \u201cAbout Damn Time\u201d and emcee Mindy Kaling joked that it was nice to be in a room with \u201cso many rich people,\u201d adding that she loved that they were supporting a president who openly promises to \u201craise your taxes.\u201d\n\nObama laid out the choice for the audience, saying that \u201cat the end of the day, you do have to make a choice about who sees you and cares about you. I\u2019m pretty confident the other guy doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Colbert said he suspected some Americans had forgotten some of the more concerning aspects of Trump\u2019s presidency, including Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nBiden said concerns over the riot reverberated outside the U.S., with foreign leaders questioning the stability of the U.S. democracy. That democracy is still fragile, he said.\n\nThe fundraiser had different tiers of access depending on a donor\u2019s generosity. Other participating celebrities included Queen Latifah, Ben Platt, Cynthia Erivo and Lea Michele. Tickets sold for as low as $225.\n\nMore money got donors more intimate time with the presidents. A photo with all three was $100,000. A donation of $250,000 earned donors access to one reception, and $500,000 got them into an even more exclusive gathering. First lady Jill Biden and DJ D-Nice hosted an afterparty at the music hall with 500 guests, the campaign said.\n\nObama and Clinton were helping Biden expand his already significant cash advantage over Trump. Biden had $155 million in cash on hand through the end of February, compared with $37 million for Trump and his Save America political action committee.\n\nThe more than $26 million tally for the New York City event includes money from supporters who handed over cash in the weeks before the fundraiser for a chance to attend. It raised $6 million more than Trump raised during February.\n\n\u201cThis historic raise is a show of strong enthusiasm for President Biden and Vice President Harris and a testament to the unprecedented fundraising machine we\u2019ve built,\u201d said campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg. \u201cUnlike our opponent, every dollar we\u2019re raising is going to reach the voters who will decide this election \u2013 communicating the president\u2019s historic record, his vision for the future and laying plain the stakes of this election.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign is expecting to bring in $33 million at a big fundraiser next week in Palm Beach, Florida, according to a person familiar with the details who spoke on condition of anonymity to confirm a number first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nTrump has kept a low profile in recent weeks, partially because of courtroom appearances for various legal cases, the bills for which he\u2019s paying with funds from donors. His next political rallies are scheduled for Tuesday in Michigan and Wisconsin. Some Republican leaders have become concerned that his campaign doesn\u2019t have the infrastructure ready for a general election battle with Biden.\n\nTrump was in the New York area on Thursday, attending the Long Island wake of a New York City police officer who was shot and killed during a traffic stop in Queens.\n\nRepublican Party Chairman Michael Whatley tried to framed the two candidates\u2019 whereabouts on Thursday as a demonstration of a \u201ccontrast in leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the same day President Trump attended the wake of slain New York Police Department officer Jonathan Diller, Joe Biden wines and dines with celebrities at a fundraiser with Barack Obama and Bill Clinton,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe facts, said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, show that violent crime rose during Trump\u2019s tenure while Biden\u2019s administration has \u201cdone the polar opposite, taking decisive action from the very beginning to fund the police and achieving a historic reduction in crime.\u201d\n\nThe setting was an unusual opportunity for the two past presidents to talk frankly about how they did the job, helping explain Biden and his presidency.\n\nAs the three men closed out the night by donning Biden\u2019s trademark sunglasses, the president quipped, \u201cDark Brandon is real,\u201d a nod to a meme featuring Biden with lasers for eyes.",

Both savings accounts have interest rates higher than the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of inflation.

However, the deadline for someone to take advantage of their full ISA allowance for 2023/24 is Friday, April 5. After this date, the ISA allowance will reset to \u00a320,000 per year for 2024/25.

      "article_text": "Could April\u2019s minimum wage hike dent hopes of a June rate cut?\n\nThe minimum wage will rise from \u00a310.42 to \u00a311.40 per hour, an increase of 9.4 per cent, in April. Will it push inflation higher?\n\nJune is looking an increasingly likely date for the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates, but one thing which could force the Bank to wait a little longer is the coming increase in the minimum wage.\n\nFrom April, the minimum wage will rise from \u00a310.42 per hour to \u00a311.40, an increase of 9.4 per cent. While this is a big increase, it follows a previous increase of 9.7 per cent in April last year.\n\nThere are fears that this hike could keep wage growth at elevated levels, just as the Bank prepares to ease the cost of borrowing. Higher wage growth could in turn prompt another round of price increases, particularly if firms are less able to absorb the extra costs than last year.\n\nRain Newton-Smith, director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), has warned that \u201cmore members than ever are telling us they\u2019re worried about the increase next month\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from a lot of businesses that they\u2019re really challenged by this because its two years in a row,\u201d Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), told City A.M.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being told there\u2019s no margin left to squeeze here,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR), in the first quarter of 2023 corporate profit margins hit their highest level in almost a decade. However, there was a \u201csignificant erosion\u201d of margins in the second half of last year as workers bargained for higher wages.\n\nSource: NIESR\n\nThis means firms may be \u201cless able to absorb the increased costs,\u201d economists at the think tank said.\n\nAccording to a March survey from the Office for National Statistics, 21.5 per cent of businesses that are considering raising prices said that labour costs was the primary reason, the highest of any factors.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that wages will go up for people earning the minimum wage. While only five per cent of workers are paid at or below the new level of minimum wage, a further 12 per cent of workers are paid up to \u00a31 above it, according to the Low Pay Commission.\n\nSurveys suggests businesses will also have to increase pay further up the ladder to maintain pay differentials. Businesses, particularly in consumer facing firms in the service sector, will come under pressure to give all of these workers a pay hike too.\n\nSource: NIESR\n\n\u201cCBI members tell us that the forthcoming rise is spurring demands for equivalent pay rises from other areas of their businesses and is pushing them to up wages along the pay scale to ensure that higher responsibilities are appropriately rewarded,\u201d Anna Leach, deputy chief economist at the CBI, told City A.M.\n\n\u201cCBI members tell us that the forthcoming rise is spurring demands for equivalent pay rises from other areas of their businesses and is pushing them to up wages along the pay scale to ensure that higher responsibilities are appropriately rewarded.\u201d Anna Leach, deputy chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry\n\nSo the minimum wage increase will definitely put up costs for firms, particularly in the accommodation and retail sector. But on an economy-wide level, the impact looks like it will be manageable.\n\nAnalysis by the Bank suggests that the April increase in the minimum wage, could push up aggregate pay growth by around 0.3 percentage points. Capital Economics expect it will add twice as much, but still think the inflationary impact will be limited.\n\nThis is because firms could respond to higher costs in a range of different ways. The Bank of England\u2019s agents survey suggests businesses will manage the increase by \u201ceroding differentials and/or reducing headcount or hours\u201d as much as by passing on higher costs to consumers.\n\nEven when costs were passed onto consumers, the survey noted that this was \u201cusually only partially\u201d.\n\nRather than raise prices, Tina McKenzie, policy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses, said firms will likely cut staff and scale back expansion plans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen 16 per cent of small firms predict they\u2019ll have to make redundancies, while 35 per cent anticipate cancelling or scaling down plans for investing and expanding in their business \u2013 highlighting a culture of caution,\u201d McKenzie told City A.M.\n\nNone of these are necessarily desirable, but it will at least limit the inflationary impact.\n\nWhile the exact impact of the minimum wage hike will only become clear further down the line, the inflationary risk it presents poses at least one potential challenge to the Bank as it looks to bring inflation back down to target.",

      "article_text": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s entertainment investments have been labeled sportswashing. That isn\u2019t putting off advertisers doing business in the country.\n\nBefore California acted as the cradle of the global tech and film industries, its money was in oil. In 1918, almost 40% of American oil was produced in the state. But the Golden State also offered early filmmakers the chance to shoot a range of different pictures \u2013 from Westerns to Biblical epics \u2013 under consistent light and amid natural splendor that could stand in for Judea as well as Dodge. And thus Los Angeles \u2013 once a rowdy oil town \u2013 was recast as the showbiz capital of the world.\n\nThe government of Saudi Arabia, another locale rich in oil and sunshine, hopes to effect a similar transition. Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in its film industry in recent years, launching the Red Sea Film Festival in 2019 and putting aside $100m into a fund intended to boost production in the country.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a wider pattern of entertainment investment by the Kingdom, which has brought both Formula One and WWE to Riyadh. Last year, it injected $1bn into the PGA Tour; since 2021, entertainment investments have totaled over $6bn.\n\nMuch of that cash has come directly from the state\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), in line with the goals of its Vision 2030 economic plan, which aims to move its economy away from fossil fuel extraction \u2013 and its global profile away from totalitarianism and towards tourism.\n\nAzhar Siddiqui, managing partner of Mediaplus Middle East, tells The Drum: \u201cSaudi Arabia's Vision 2030 places sports and entertainment at the heart of its economic diversification strategy\u2026 the country's substantial investments in sports infrastructure and hosting of high-profile international events have elevated its global profile, making it an attractive platform for brands seeking to tap into new and vibrant audiences.\u201d\n\nFor brand marketers looking to reach the international middle classes, does any of this matter?\n\nThe Kingdom is the largest economy in the Middle East and host to a young population of some 36 million people, just short of California\u2019s 39 million. That makes it a compelling target market for multinational brands looking for new sources of growth, despite allegations by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that its investments amount to \u2018sportswashing\u2019.\n\nWell, according to agency execs working within the country, advertisers are biting. \u201cSaudi\u2019s focus on hosting and promoting the largest entertainment and sporting events has created numerous growth opportunities for brands within the marketing and advertising space,\u201d says Adel Baraja, chief executive officer of Publicis Communications KSA.\n\n\u201cIf we look at the sports industry, it wasn\u2019t too long ago that sponsors were limited, and it was up to the clubs to offer creative sponsorship solutions to attract interest. The influx of world-class footballers and hosting some of the most important sporting events put a global spotlight on the Kingdom as a whole,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis accelerated interest from private brands across a diversity of sectors including FCMG, automotive and retail who are now keen to have a presence.\u201d\n\nSiddiqui says that its entertainment and sports investments have \u201ctransformed the Kingdom into a dynamic market for new brands and advertising opportunities,\u201d by creating new space for sponsorship and targeted advertising.\n\nMedia investment from brands is rising, says Baraja. So is the need for content produced within the country. \u201cSaudi Arabia has always been a major media market with its young, tech-savvy population \u2013 more than 50% are under 30 years of age, but for many years much of the content was produced in other countries. When you consider that there is 85%-98% media penetration for both online and offline media platforms and the average Saudi spends 12.4 hours consuming media, there are tremendous opportunities for brands to connect with their audiences alongside the evolving number of media offerings available.\u201d\n\nServiceplan, the German-headquartered agency network, has a major office in Dubai. Last year, it won its first industry award for a campaign produced in Saudi Arabia for a Toyota dealership.\n\nRami Hmadeh, managing partner at Serviceplan Arabia, says that it marks a \u201cgrowing openness among brands within the country to invest in advertising.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis trend likely reflects an increasing recognition of the value of strategic advertising in driving brand awareness and engagement in a competitive market. As the country continues to embrace economic diversification and digital transformation, particularly under Vision 2030, brands seem more willing to allocate resources towards creative and impactful advertising strategies,\u201d Hmadeh adds. He says the agency network is itself investing in the country, recruiting Saudi creatives.\n\n\u201cLocal professionals offer an authentic voice and perspective that can significantly enhance the effectiveness of campaigns by ensuring they resonate on a cultural level. Moreover, this approach facilitates the development of strong local partnerships, essential for navigating the regulatory environment,\u201d he says.\n\nIn California, ad agencies eventually followed filmmakers and starlets west. Saudi Arabia probably won\u2019t be able to unseat Hollywood for film production, but brands will continue to look east anyway. Baraji says: \u201dAs Saudi continues to tell its story to the world, brands are capitalizing on this global platform to explore innovative partnerships, diversify their audiences and enhance their brand image.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Drum\u2019s special focus on the entertainment industry",

(Reuters)\n\nForeign oil firms operating in Iraq's Kurdistan region are partly to blame for the delay in resuming crude exports after failing to submit contracts for revision, Iraq's oil ministry said.\n\nThe Iraq-T\u00fcrkiye oil pipeline (ITP) which once handled about 0.5% of global oil supply has been halted, stuck in legal and financial limbo, since March 2023.\n\nThe flows were halted after the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce in a longstanding arbitration case ruled Ankara had violated provisions of a 1973 treaty by facilitating such exports without the consent of the Iraqi federal government.\n\nIraq's oil ministry in a statement published late on Sunday noted that foreign companies, alongside the Iraqi Kurdish authorities, have still not submitted contracts for revision to the ministry.\n\nThe government is seeking to revise such deals after a court ruled ones signed with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) were invalid, it said in response to a statement on Saturday by the Association of the Petroleum Industry of Kurdistan (APIKUR).\n\nIraq's federal court in 2022 deemed an oil and gas law regulating the Kurdistan region's oil and gas industry as unconstitutional.\n\nIraq owes T\u00fcrkiye minimum payments as long as the pipeline is technically operational - estimated by consultancy Wood Mackenzie at around $25 million per month. APIKUR has cited a similar figure saying it understands Iraq owes $800,000 in daily penalties.\n\nAPIKUR said the government of Iraq had not \"taken the required actions\" to reopen ITP, adding that \"there has been no real progress\" to reopen ITP despite meetings in Baghdad in January between representatives of the Iraqi government, the KRG and international oil companies.\n\nAPIKUR said its member companies' \"current commercial terms and economic model must be maintained\" and called for payment assurances for past and future oil exports.\n\nIraq's Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani is due to meet US President Joe Biden in Washington on April 15 to discuss the future of the US-led coalition in Iraq, as well as Iraqi financial reforms and a US push to wean Iraq - a rare ally of both Washington and Tehran - off Iranian power and gas.\n\nAPIKUR said it had conveyed to members of Biden's administration and Congress that the White House should not proceed with the planned visit unless flows through ITP resume, international oil firms get payment assurances and the Iraqi government fully implements the Iraqi federal budget for the KRG.\n\nResponding to a Reuters request for comment, a US State Department spokesperson said the US government \"encourages all parties to reach an agreement to resume the flow of oil through the Iraq- T\u00fcrkiye pipeline as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Restarting oil exports through the Iraq-T\u00fcrkiye pipeline would be beneficial for all parties,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "article_text": "Dramatic downfall. Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison for masterminding $8bn fraud that brought down FTX\n\nFormer crypto billionaire and FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has found out his fate, after a judge sentenced him to a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nReuters reported that on Thursday Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for stealing $8 billion from customers of the now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded.\n\nIt comes after Bankman-Fried had in November 2023, after a month long trial, been found guilty of all US charges (including fraud, money-laundering and stealing funds) for his role in the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research.\n\nPrison sentence\n\nFTX had collapsed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection back in November 2022, when a multi-billion dollar hole was found in its balance sheet \u2013 amid reports of financial impropriety.\n\nThe collapse was triggered after FTX management had failed to a secure rescue bid and additional funding.\n\nIn January 2024 FTX abandoned efforts to restart its crypto exchange, instead opted to liquidate all assets and return funds to customers.\n\nNow Reuters reported that US District Judge Lewis Kaplan has handed down a stiff prison sentence at a Manhattan court hearing, after rejecting Bankman-Fried\u2019s claim that FTX customers did not actually lose money and finding that he lied during his trial testimony.\n\nJudge Kaplan also said Bankman-Fried had shown no remorse.\n\n\u201cHe knew it was wrong,\u201d Judge Kaplan reportedly said before handing down the sentence. \u201cHe knew it was criminal. He regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood of getting caught. But he is not going to admit a thing, as is his right.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried reportedly stood with his hands clasped before him as Judge Kaplan read the sentence.\n\nHe spoke with his defence lawyer Marc Mukasey briefly before he was led out of the courtroom by members of the US Marshals Service after the hearing.\n\nDeliberate lies\n\n\u201cHis deliberate and ongoing lies demonstrated a brazen disregard for customers\u2019 expectations and disrespect for the rule of law,\u201d Damian Williams, the US Attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement.\n\nJudge Kaplan found that FTX customers lost $8 billion, FTX\u2019s equity investors lost $1.7 billion, and that lenders to the Alameda Research hedge fund Bankman-Fried founded lost $1.3 billion.\n\nThe judge also said Bankman-Fried lied during his testimony when he said he did not know that his hedge fund had spent customer deposits taken from FTX.\n\nBankman-Fried had potentially been facing a prison sentence of 100 plus years.\n\nIn February his defence lawyer Marc Mukasey had urged the judge not to impose that 100 year sentence, and instead argued that a sentence of less than 5 to 6 years would be appropriate.\n\nFederal prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 40 to 50 years.\n\nBankman-Fried comments\n\nBefore his sentencing, Bankman-Fried had addressed the court for 20 minutes and admitted to the judge during the hearing that FTX customers had suffered and he offered an apology to his former FTX colleagues \u2013 but he did not admit criminal wrongdoing.\n\nAddressing the judge, Bankman-Fried was quoted by Reuters as saying, \u201cCustomers have been suffering \u2026 I didn\u2019t at all mean to minimise that. I also think that\u2019s something that was missing from what I\u2019ve said over the course of this process, and I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d\n\nReferring to his FTX colleagues, Bankman-Fried reportedly told the judge, \u201cThey put a lot of themselves into it, and I threw that all away. It haunts me every day.\u201d\n\nThree of his former close associates testified as prosecution witnesses at trial that he had directed them to use FTX customer funds to plug losses at Alameda Research.\n\nAll three have pleaded guilty to fraud.\n\nBankman-Fried has vowed to appeal his conviction and sentence.\n\nNot Bernie Madoff\n\nDuring the hearing, defence counsel Mukasey had reportedly sought to distance his client from notorious fraudsters like Bernie Madoff.\n\n\u201cSam was not a ruthless financial serial killer who set out every morning to hurt people,\u201d Mukasey was quoted by Reuters as saying, describing his client as an \u201cawkward math nerd\u201d who worked hard to get customers their money back after FTX\u2019s collapse.",

Meanwhile, Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) lagging price action has resulted in bearish forecasts for the meme coin\u2019s upcoming performance. On the other hand, top market experts suggest Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RECQ as the best coin to invest in 2024 due to its fantastic growth potential.\n\nDOGE Aims For the $0.30 Threshold\n\nDogecoin bulls suggest DOGE as the top crypto to invest in 2024 based on Dogecoin\u2019s impressive price performance and the token\u2019s continued rallies in terms of trading volume. Furthermore, some of Elon Musk\u2019s recent posts on X have sparked speculations that the platform could soon integrate DOGE as a payment method.\n\nHence, multiple crypto analysts have given a positive DOGE price prediction, stating that Dogecoin could increase above the $0.30 mark by the year\u2019s close. DOGE traded at around $0.18 during the last week of March, which means that Dogecoin holders could obtain more than 66.66% gains.\n\nOn the other hand, Dogecoin bears expect significant dips within the next DOGE price movements due to the meme coin\u2019s increased market volatility. As for the latest negative Dogecoin price forecast, DOGE could decrease to under $0.09 by the end of 2024.\n\nSHIB Bears Expect Dips Toward $0.000008\n\nAccording to Shiba Inu bears, SHIB could decrease to $0.000008 by the end of the year as holders switch over to other platforms that bring more significant short-term gains. SHIB traded around the $0.000030 range during the final week of March, meaning that Shiba Inu could decrease by as much as 73.33% over the forthcoming term.\n\nHowever, Shiba Inu supporters praise SHIB as a good crypto to buy due to its massive future potential and Shiba Inu\u2019s excellent ranking by market capitalization. On top of that, the Australian-based exchange Bitcoin.com.au enabled trading in SHIB on March 25.\n\nTherefore, Shiba Inu bulls are convinced that SHIB could manage to exceed the $0.000050 level by the end of 2024. Analysts point to Shiba Inu\u2019s remarkable surges in terms of TVL as another important factor behind this bullish SHIB price prediction.\n\nSeasoned Investors Pick $RECQ as the Best Cryptocurrency To Buy Now\n\nRebel Satoshi is an exciting meme coin project that is poised to spearhead the new decentralized revolution. Additionally, Rebel Satoshi\u2019s community-based approach empowers token holders to receive extraordinary rewards for participating in the platform\u2019s vibrant two token ecosystem.\n\nThe amazing $RBLZ token grants governance rights and other exclusive benefits, such as access to token burns and discounts on Rebel Satoshi merchandise. On top of that, $RBLZ raised over $2.5 million during the presale and launched at $0.025 on the Uniswap DEX on March 4.\n\nMeanwhile, Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RECQ is priced at only $0.002 at the Early Bird Stage of the token\u2019s presale, which means that investors are looking at astonishing 525% gains when $RECQ attains the $0.0125 presale target. Furthermore, $RECQ provides exclusive access to the incredible Rebel Satoshi Arcade and boasts excellent utility as Rebel Satoshi\u2019s base currency for everyday transactions.\n\n$RECQ has the potential to outclass DOGE and SHIB and emerge as the next leader in the meme coin market, so don\u2019t hesitate to join Rebel Satoshi\u2019s uprising today!\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram",

      "article_text": "Nationwide Building Society has launched two new issues of popular ISA products which offer inflation-busting interest rates.\n\nHowever, savers only have a couple of weeks to take advantage of these accounts in the 2023/24 financial year before a pending deadline in less than two weeks time.\n\nThe products in question are the building society\u2019s one-year and two-year fixed ISAs. Both savings accounts have interest rates higher than the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of inflation. For the 12 months to February 2024, inflation in the UK plummeted to 3.4 per cent, the lowest in over two years. However, the deadline for someone to take advantage of their full ISA allowance for 2023/24 is Friday, April 5. After this date, the ISA allowance will reset to \u00a320,000 per year for 2024/25. Do you have a money story you\u2019d like to share? Get in touch by emailing money@gbnews.uk.\n\nNationwide has launched two new ISAs ahead of an important deadline GETTY\n\nThrough ISAs, savers are able to deposit money into the savings product tax-free up to a certain amount. Account holders can place up to \u00a320,000 in one ISA or split the allowance across multiple different accounts. With their latest issue, Nationwide Building Society\u2019s savings accounts are offering customers: One-year fixed rate ISA - offering 4.50 per cent AER/tax-free\n\nTwo-year fixed rate ISA - offering 4.20 per cent AER/tax-free.\n\nBritons who want to take advantage of these rates, that are higher than inflation, and use their full tax-free allowance for this year have days left to do so, according to experts. James Hyde, a spokesman for Moneyfactscompare, issued a stark warning about the \u201climited time\u201d savers have. He explained: \u201cThe new tax-year in April is less than a fortnight away, and savers who wish to utilise their full ISA allowance now have limited time to do so. \u201cProviders would traditionally improve their ISA rates, as competition for last-minute investment intensifies.",

      "article_text": "The Mirror has rounded up five key bills that are due to get more expensive from next week, including broadband, mobile and council tax, plus water and TV licence\n\nFamilies up and down the country are about to be hit with higher bills - but there are ways to cut costs.\n\nBroadband, mobile and council tax are all set to become more expensive, as is the price you pay for water and your TV licence. If you\u2019re worried about your bills going up, then now is the time to go through your finances and work out how you can fight back.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to lower your bills, from getting a better broadband package to checking if you're able to get a discount on your council tax. Here is everything you need to know.\n\nBroadband, TV and mobile\n\nImage: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBroadband and mobile customers will be hit with bill rises of up to 8.8% starting from March 31. Under current rules, telecom firms are allowed to increase prices mid-contract in line with inflation, plus up to 3.9% extra on top of this.\n\nMost use Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation data for December, or Retail Prices Index (RPI) for January to decide their increases. You can read our company-by-company breakdown, including Sky, BT and TalkTalk, that shows how much your bill will rise here.\n\nHow to cut your bill: If you're out of contract, you can leave and go elsewhere or haggle down your current provider. Start by comparing prices elsewhere to see what other deals are available. Take a look at how many minutes, texts and how much data you currently use, so you can find similar plans that suit your needs.\n\nYou may find you're actually paying too much right now for allowances that you're not using. When haggling, explain the better deals you've seen elsewhere then ask if the company can match or beat that price. For mobile packages, you'll normally find SIM-only plans are the cheapest.\n\nCouncil tax\n\nMost households in England will see their council tax rise by around 5% from April 1. This is the maximum amount allowed without a referendum. However, four councils in England \u2013 Birmingham, Slough, Thurrock and Woking \u2013 have been granted special permission to impose a 10% rise. Use our council tax calculator to see how much your bill is going up by.\n\nThe majority of homes in Wales will see council tax rise by between around 5% and 10% while in Scotland, council tax bills have been frozen in the most places until April 2025. If you live in Northern Ireland, there is a rates system used for council tax.\n\nHow to cut your bill: You may be entitled to a council tax discount ranging between 25% to 100% off your bill, depending on your personal circumstances and living arrangements. For example, if you live alone, then you'll get a 25% discount.\n\nThose who claim benefits may be entitled to help through a Council Tax Support or Council Tax Reduction scheme, which could see you get 100% off your bill. You may also be able to challenge your council tax bill if you think you're in the wrong band.\n\nThis could see you owed thousands of pounds back and pay lower council tax going forward. You need to do your research first though, as you could end up being moved up a council tax band - and this may also affect your neighbours.\n\nWater\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nWater bills in England and Wales will rise by 6% on average from April 1. The typical household will see their yearly bill increase from \u00a3445 to \u00a3473, a rise of \u00a327. Hafren Dyfrdwy customers will see the biggest percentage change, with the typical bill rising by 20% from \u00a3362 to \u00a3433 - an increase of \u00a371.\n\nWessex Water and Anglian Water households will be hit with the biggest average bills, with their costs set to increase to \u00a3548 and \u00a3529 respectively. Water bills in Scotland will increase by an average of \u00a335.95 a year, or 8.8%, from April.\n\nHow to cut your bill: Using less water is the most obvious way to cut your bill. You could see if a water meter would save you money. Martin Lewis suggests, as a general rule of thumb, that you could save cash if you have more or the same number of bedrooms in your house than people.\n\nCheck out the free water meter calculator on the Consumer Council for Water website. Households can also claim free water-saving devices through Save Water Save Money. The gadgets include shower heads which help regulate water usage, tap inserts to regulate water flow, and cistern bags, so each flush uses less water.\n\nTV licence\n\nThe price of a TV licence will rise from \u00a3159 to \u00a3169.50 from April 1. You need a TV licence if you watch or record live TV programmes on any channel. You also need a TV licence if you're using BBC iPlayer, regardless of whether you're watching a show on catch-up. If you're caught without a TV licence, you risk a \u00a31,000 fine.\n\nYou don't need a TV licence if you're watching shows on catch-up using streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, ITVX, Disney Plus, YouTube, All 4 or My5. The rules are different if you\u2019re watching live shows through these services, in which case you would need a TV licence.\n\nHow to cut your bill: If you're aged over 75 and you claim claiming Pension Credit, you can get a free TV licence. Students who are living away from home may also be covered if their parents have a TV licence, but only if they're watching TV on a device that isn't plugged into the mains, such as a phone, tablet or laptop.\n\nIf someone in your household is blind or severely sight-impaired, you'll get 50% off the cost of your TV licence. Or if you live in residential care or sheltered accommodation, you may be able to apply for a concessionary TV licence which costs \u00a37.50 per room, flat or bungalow\n\nCar tax\n\nCar tax will increase in line with Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation from April 1. How much you have to pay depends on when your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses. If your car was first registered on or after April 1, 2017, your annual car tax will increase from \u00a3180 to \u00a3190 for petrol and diesel cars.\n\nYou can check how much car tax you pay on your vehicle on GOV.UK. Some vehicles are charged \u00a30 for car tax - but even if you don\u2019t need to pay anything, you still need to renew your vehicle every year with the DVLA.\n\nHow to cut your bill: Pay your car tax bill for the year up front if you can. If you're due to change cars, it is worth looking at vehicles that produce a lower level of CO2.",

      "article_text": "As a US District Court judge sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to 25 years in prison, the judge reminded the fallen crypto leader that he voluntarily committed perjury three times during his trial. Sadly, criminal conduct is unremarkable among businessmen in the digital asset space. For years, founders of crypto projects have withheld information, lied, failed to register with appropriate regulatory agencies, or executed complicated schemes to evade regulations.\n\nCrypto perjury has a particularly long-standing tradition.\n\nPerjury is a serious crime because it is often an additional, voluntary action that criminals choose to commit after they have already committed more serious crimes. Legally defined, perjury is \u201ca false statement under oath or knowingly signing a legal document that is false or includes false statements.\u201d In other words, someone commits perjury when they intentionally lie about a material issue when legally communicating with officers of a court.\n\nThe temptation to lie is particularly strong as the day of reckoning nears in a criminal trial. As their factual and legal defenses fail, defendants wanting to lessen a prison sentence are tempted to simply lie outright. For this reason, perjury is also classified as a crime that increases recommended prison sentencing terms.\n\nThe most famous self-perjurer in the crypto industry is Craig Wright, who is famous for having not invented Bitcoin. Wright perjured himself in the presence of a US magistrate judge. Eventually, a UK High Court of Justice judge summarily humiliated his self-proclamation. According to the world\u2019s supreme copyright court, Wright does not own Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper copyright and is not Bitcoin\u2019s creator.\n\nWright\u2019s longtime financial supporter Calvin Ayre quit social media after that definitive ruling, using the excuse of a pre-planned \u201cadventure.\u201d\n\nRead more: Where in the world is Sam Trabucco? FTX victims launch manhunt\n\nOther examples of crypto perjury\n\nAnother crypto bigwig who perjured himself in court was Konstantin Ignatov of OneCoin fame. Ignatov was the brother of \u201cCryptoQueen\u201d Ruja Ignatova who led one of the largest Ponzi schemes in crypto history. Ignatov falsely told a judge that he threw away his laptop in a Las Vegas trash can. In fact, Ignatov\u2019s co-conspirator took that laptop onto safe transport outside the US. US authorities are still looking for that laptop with OneCoin data.\n\nAnother famous crypto perjury actually made it to the silver screen in Netflix\u2019s Bitconned. After committing crimes via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) called Centra Tech, co-founders Raymond Trapani and Robert Farkas pled guilty to perjury in the first degree. Both admitted to lying under oath. They committed perjury in an attempt to defend their third co-founder, Sohrab Sharma, in his criminal trial.\n\nAnother lesser-known crypto perjury case involves Frank Ahlgren III. The US Department of Justice indicted Ahlgren for not reporting capital gains from BTC transactions on three years of IRS tax returns. Because Ahlgren III signed his tax returns as true under penalty of perjury, any false statements are perjurious. His criminal case began this year and is still ongoing.\n\nFailure to disclose crypto investments on a US tax return carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, disgorgement of unpaid taxes, and fines of up to $100,000 per year. Because tens of millions of American crypto investors file IRS tax returns every year with dubious accuracy, this form of perjury might be the most pervasive type of crypto perjury.\n\nDespite its severe punishment terms and the voluntary nature of committing perjury, there is a disturbing trend of crypto criminals resorting to this last-ditch defense. Needless to say, a judge is the last person in the world that anyone wants to catch them lying. Unfortunately, for many of the world\u2019s most brazen crypto criminals, judges were able to uncover the truth.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

      "article_text": "UK commercial vehicle (CV) production almost doubled in February, with 12,927 vans, trucks, taxis, buses and coaches leaving factory lines, according to figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The 98.4 per cent uplift in volume was the best February performance since 2008 and follows a particularly weak February last year as supply chain issues, notably semiconductor shortages, impacted manufacturing output.\n\nFebruary\u2019s production boost was driven by significant demand for British-built vehicles in overseas markets. Exports increased by 188 per cent to 10,011 units, representing 77.4% of all CVs made in the month, with more than nine in 10 destined for the EU. Conversely, output for the domestic market fell for the second month in a row, down -4 per cent to 2,916 units, although this represented a decline of just 123 vehicles.\n\nIn the year to date, 24,683 CVs have been built in Britain, up some 56.4 per cent on the first two months of 2023. Exports have driven this growth, up 104.5 per cent to 17,976 units, an increase of 9,184, while volumes for the home market have fallen by 279 to 6,707 units.\n\nMike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said: \u201cCV manufacturing has kickstarted the year with two months of impressive growth as robust overseas demand for British-built vans continues. The challenge now is to maintain this success amidst fierce global competition, accelerating production of zero emission vehicles to enable the fast paced delivery of these critical models. Strong performing economies at home and abroad will be key to this ambition.\u201d",
