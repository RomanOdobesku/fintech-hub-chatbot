      "article_text": "Big tech may be driving the stock market, but after a blow-out first quarter, big oil would like a word.\n\nBig tech may be driving the stock market, but after a blow-out first quarter, big oil would like a word.\n\nAfter finishing 2023 in the red as the broader market soared, energy stocks have started 2024 with a sharp rally that has them beating tech indexes this year. Specifically, the closely watched Energy Select Sector exchange-traded fund, or XLE, is up more than 13% since the start of January while the Nasdaq 100 Index has gained just 8.7%. Rising oil is helping, as West Texas Intermediate crude broke above $80 a barrel in mid-March for the first time since November and held there.\n\n\u201cMost investors coming into 2024 weren\u2019t expecting anything out of energy,\u201d Roth analyst Leo Mariani said by phone. But the stocks \u201croared back like a lion with an awesome March.\u201d\n\nEnergy led the the S&P 500\u2019s 11 market sectors last month, rising more than 10% compared with the next closest group, utilities, at 6.3%, and the 3.1% gain in the broader index. Following that performance, energy investors are now looking to the April 3 OPEC oil-market monitoring meeting for clues on crude\u2019s direction, which could add fuel the rally or cause it to stall.\n\n\u201cRight now, investor sentiment could go either way,\u201d Pickering Energy Partners Chief Executive Officer Dan Pickering said. He likened energy\u2019s first-quarter to the beginning of a binge-worthy TV show. \u201cA number of people 1.5 episodes in, trying to commit to whether they binge this season \u2014 and Q2 may be the point where you say, I\u2019m staying up all night.\u201d\n\nWhat OPEC Says\n\nSome of that will depend on what OPEC+ members say this week, particularly if they signal plans to hold the line on previously announced voluntary cuts through the first half.\n\n\u201cI think at this point, the market is expecting OPEC to maintain restraint,\u201d Hennessey Funds portfolio manager Ben Cook said by phone. He likened the OPEC meeting to a Federal Reserve decision, where the outcome may be expected, but the messaging is equally important.\n\nRussia\u2019s decision to cut production could push Brent crude to $100 a barrel this year, JPMorgan analysts led by Natasha Kaneva wrote. It\u2019s currently trading in the high $80s and could reach the $90s by May, they wrote.\n\nAmid that bullishness, some investors are snapping up shares in mid-sized oil producers, which offer more torque to the rising commodity price. Diamondback Energy Inc., for example, is up 28% this year and climbed every day but two in March while posting 15-day winning streak, the longest for any S&P 500 stock this year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see the most rapid pickup in earnings estimates will not be on the largest producers because they have lower costs,\u201d said Cole Smead, president of Smead Capital Management. \u201cIt will be on the smaller producers.\u201d Some of the stocks he\u2019s buying are Apa Corp. and Ovintiv Inc., as well Canadian producers such as MEG Energy Corp. and Strathcona Resources Ltd.\n\nRefining stocks have been hot for even longer than oil companies. The VanEck Oil Refiners ETF is up up over 15% in the last five months, outperforming integrated companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. as well as gains in crude.\n\nRefining Bets\n\nThe refined products market has been tight, and capacity has only gotten more precious as Ukrainian military strikes knock out Russian facilities. That\u2019s why some investors see the refining business as a way to play the rally in energy from here.\n\n\u201cWe have spare capacity in crude, but refining capacity is what\u2019s really being constrained by the Red Sea and by what\u2019s happening with Russia,\u201d said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Group. \u201cSo the story behind the scenes is really in the products.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Wall Street widely expects energy stocks to post declining earnings this year, including an almost 27% drop in first-quarter profits thanks to lower year-over-year oil prices. That\u2019s by far the worst expected performance of any S&P 500 sector, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nHowever, some analysts are starting to flip those expectations. Morgan Stanley US equity strategist Mike Wilson, for instance, upgraded energy to overweight on a combination of rising oil prices, \u201cinflecting earnings revisions, strong breadth and compelling valuations.\u201d Energy valuations continue to trade at a historic discount to the S&P 500 and, with higher free cash flow yields, there is \u201ca path to further outperformance,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients on March 25.\n\nIndeed, energy is also the cheapest sector in the market, which is helping draw new investors in, even as the rally remains somewhat lowkey so far.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a quiet rally in this sector that is catching a few people by surprise,\u201d BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeremy McCrea said, adding that investors who were betting on an electric future are beginning to think that \u201cmaybe we\u2019re going to be using oil and gas for a bit longer than expected.\u201d"

      "article_text": "More than \u00a320billion was wiped off the value of Tesla last night after it reported the first fall in car sales for four years.\n\nThe US electric car maker, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered 386,810 vehicles in the three months to the end of March.\n\nIt was enough for the firm to reclaim its crown as the world\u2019s top seller of electric cars following a slump in sales at Chinese rival BYD.\n\nBut the total was down by more than fifth from the previous quarter and around 9 per cent less than in the same period of 2023.\n\nIt was the first year-on-year fall in sales since 2020 when the business was brought to an effective standstill by Covid-19.\n\nDarker days: Tesla boss Elon Musk has seen the electric car maker's first slump in sales in four years\n\nTesla shares fell more than 5 per cent, wiping \u00a322billion off the value of the company.\n\nThe stock has lost a third of its value this year.\n\nAnalysts branded the update an \u2018unmitigated disaster\u2019 for Tesla and Musk.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been another bad day for Elon Musk,\u2019 said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at broker AJ Bell.\n\nThe total number of cars delivered by Tesla was well below Wall Street expectations of 454,000 amid weakening demand for electric vehicles (EVs). However, Tesla was able to reclaim its crown as the world\u2019s leading EV seller.\n\nBYD, which is backed by Warren Buffett, overtook Tesla in the final quarter of 2023 when it sold 526,409 electric vehicles compared to Tesla\u2019s 484,507.\n\nThis led some analysts to dub the company as the \u2018Tesla Killer\u2019 after it came out on top in a brutal price war in China, a country which builds and buys more electric cars than the rest of the world combined.\n\nIn January Musk warned that Chinese car makers were set to \u2018demolish\u2019 global rivals.\n\nBut BYD\u2019s supremacy over Tesla has proven short-lived.\n\nBYD bosses on Monday revealed the firm delivered just 300,114 EVs in the final quarter of 2024.\n\nBoth Tesla and BYD have suffered as demand for electric cars continues to soften in favour of hybrid or petrol alternatives. Tesla said growth this year would be \u2018notably lower\u2019 than in 2023.\n\nSlowdown: Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the three months to the end of March. Shares fell more than 5%, wiping \u00a322bn off the value of the company\n\nAnd the company cited \u2018shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict\u2019 and an arson attack at its Berlin factory for its slowing production rates.\n\nIt produced just 433,371 vehicles during the quarter \u2013 again far less than the 494,989 that rolled off its assembly lines in the final three months of 2023.\n\nDan Ives, tech analyst at wealth manager Wedbush, said it was a \u2018nightmare quarter for Tesla with [Musk] pressured by the Wall Street and China demand remaining very soft coming out of the gates for 2024\u2019.\n\nDescribing the fall in sales as an \u2018unmitigated disaster\u2019, he added: \u2018This as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black-eye first quarter.\n\nOtherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative.\n\nFor Musk, this is a \u201cfork-in-the-road\u201d time to get Tesla through this turbulent period.\n\nHewson said: \u2018Tesla\u2019s not alone when it comes to waning excitement about the shift to green motoring, as price sensitive consumers are less likely to change ingrained habits.\n\n\u2018This feels more like a bump in the road than a stop light.\u2019"

Lewis, who founded the investment firm Tavistock Group, faced as long as 45 years in prison if he had been found guilty at trial.\n\nHe initially denied 16 counts of securities fraud and three counts of conspiracy last July after he was accused of passing on tips about companies to friends, personal assistants, private pilots and romantic partners.\n\nBy \u2018orchestrating\u2019 the \u2018brazen insider trading scheme\u2019, Lewis enabled them to make millions of dollars in profit, prosecutors said.\n\n\u2018I am so embarrassed and I apologise to the court for my conduct,\u2019 said Lewis in January. According to the 2023 Sunday Times Rich List, he has a fortune of more than \u00a35billion.\n\nTavistock Group has stakes in around 200 firms across the property, sports, finance, energy and life sciences companies.\n\nIts investments include ENIC, which bought a controlling stake in Premier League Spurs in 2001.

But the oil giant claims the order lacks a legal basis\n\nHe warned that support for going green will be lost if supply becomes too expensive or unreliable.\n\n\u2018If people can no longer pay for their energy or that energy is no longer reliable when you press the button or want to cook food and turn on the gas stove, the support of people in the country here, but also in other countries, for the energy transition will be lost,\u2019 he said.\n\nThe energy crisis caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine proved the importance of fossil fuels, Lunsingh Scheurleer argued.\n\n\u2018Oil and gas will play an important role in both the security of supply and affordability during the energy transition,\u2019 he said.\n\nLawyers for the energy giant highlighted Shell\u2019s investment in non-fossil fuels, its support for the Paris Climate Agreement and its own emission-cutting targets.\n\nBut the order to slash the total emissions of its products by 45 per cent went too far, Lunsingh Scheurleer said.\n\n\u2018A general application of this order is impossible without drastic measures,\u2019 he said.\n\nA Shell spokesman said: \u2018We agree that the world needs urgent climate action, but we have a different view in how that goal should be achieved.\n\n\u2018By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change.\u2019\n\nGreen activists Friends of the Earth Netherlands, which brought the case, said it was confident heading into the appeal.\n\n\u2018The scientific basis on which we\u2019ve founded our claims against Shell has only solidified,\u2019 the group\u2019s lawyer Roger Cox said. \u2018I am confident we can once again convince the judges that Shell needs to act in line with international climate agreements.\u2019\n\nShell rowed back on its carbon reduction plans last month, citing strong gas demand and uncertainty in the energy transition.\n\nThe company will target a 15 per cent to 20 per cent reduction in net carbon intensity of its energy products by 2030, compared with 2016 intensity levels. It had previously aimed for a 20 per cent cut."

S&P Global said its index of activity in UK factories rose from 47.5 in February to 50.3 in March\n\nBut with Labour well ahead in the polls, that may not be enough to save the Tories in a general election expected later in 2024.\n\nWhile the UK economy is bouncing back, the eurozone managed a score of just 46.1 as the region took another turn for the worse.\n\nThe region was dragged down by France and Germany which recorded readings of 46.2 and 41.9 respectively.\n\nCyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, described the figures as \u2018disheartening\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector usually runs on several cylinders, mainly the countries of Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\n\nTogether they account for three quarters of the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing industry.\n\n\u2018We have the unusual situation that two cylinders, Germany and France, are more or less out of action. A sustainable economic turnaround can only be expected once all cylinders are back in motion.\u2019\n\nBritain fell into recession at the end of last year as a decline in economic output of 0.1 per cent in the third quarter was followed by another decline of 0..3 per cent in the fourth.\n\nEurope managed to skirt recession, however, though there was no growth across the EU in the third or fourth quarters of last year.\n\nIn the eurozone, output fell 0.1 per cent in the third quarter but was flat in the final three months of 2023, meaning it also avoided recession.\n\nBut while much of Europe continues to struggle \u2013 and in particular Germany \u2013 the recession in the UK is widely seen as over.\n\nHailing the \u2018green shoots of recovery\u2019 in the UK, RSM economist Tom Pugh said the \u2018encouraging\u2019 manufacturing figures \u2018add to evidence that last year\u2019s recession is already over\u2019.\n\nHe said the recession will turn to be \u2018one of the smallest and shortest on record\u2019 and went on: \u2018We expect the economy to gradually pick up steam over the rest of the year as lower inflation, falling interest rates and tax cuts boost consumer spending.\u2019\n\nSeparate figures from Nationwide showed house prices unexpectedly fell 0.2 per cent last month following a 0.7 per cent rise in February.\n\nBut data from the Bank of England showed mortgage lending is at its highest level for 17 months in a sign confidence is returning."

The price of a first class stamp has gone up three times in a year \u2013 from 95p to \u00a31.10 in April 2023 and then to \u00a31.25 in October.\n\nIt comes at a critical juncture for Royal Mail as Ofcom is considering its future and the \u2018universal service obligation\u2019 to deliver letters six days a week.\n\nThe industry regulator revealed in a long-awaited report in January that an overhaul could see Royal Mail\u2019s letter delivery service slashed from six days to five \u2013 or even three \u2013 a week.\n\nOfcom has since been consulting on the proposals, with a deadline of today for responses.\n\nIt will report back its findings in the summer.\n\nGilthorpe has worked at Europe\u2019s busiest airport since 2009 and managed Heathrow\u2019s response to pandemic.\n\nShe said: \u2018Royal Mail is a great British brand with a long and proud history.

      "article_text": "The newly chosen chief executive of the Royal Mail, Emma Gilthorpe, has an unenviable task.\n\nRunning Britain\u2019s postal delivery service has proved a poison chalice. A combination of sharply declining volumes of post, the six-day-a-week universal delivery obligation and a combative workforce has defeated several predecessors.\n\nIt resulted in heavy losses and sent the share price of parent International Distributions Services sharply lower.\n\nModernisation has not been helped by the way in which \u2018snail mail\u2019 volumes have plummeted.\n\nThe current system was designed to deliver 20billion letters a day. That number has plummeted to 7billion and the forecast is that it could fall to 4billion.\n\nFresh challenges: Coming from Heathrow, with its uncertain ownership, newly chosen Royal Mail Boss Emma Gilthorpe (pictured) is moving from the frying pan into the fire\n\nWe have all become accustomed to invitations and Christmas cards arriving by email.\n\nOnline scams mean that the necessity of irreproachable correspondence from HMRC and others is still wanted. The handwritten note still has an allure.\n\nOfcom, the regulator, has offered some relief from the universal delivery obligation. These found favour with Gilthorpe\u2019s interim predecessor Martin Seidenberg, drafted in from the top company.\n\nOne way forward is to dramatically widen the gap between urgent or first-class service and the rest.\n\nAt the cost of \u00a31.35 (from yesterday) first-class delivery may already be considered excessive. If a six-day \u2018urgent\u2019 service is to be maintained, the public will be obliged to accept something even more pricey.\n\nThe Royal Mail will need to provide certainty of next day delivery and modern Amazon-style tracking.\n\nAs for lower value mail, such as direct marketing and those personal notes, a second-class stamp will provide less frequent delivery services, maybe just three days a week.\n\nThat would be better than in Denmark where postal services have been consigned to the scrapheap.\n\nComing from Heathrow, with its uncertain ownership, Gilthorpe is moving from the frying pan into the fire. Unions and public permitting, it is possible to see a sensible way forward.\n\nHalf full\n\nThe Tory message is that the economy is turning the corner. Manufacturing has been a drag on growth in recent times.\n\nServices, boosted by finance, the professions and R&D, have been going great guns. Industry picked up momentum in March with the purchasing managers index moving into growth territory after 20 months in the doldrums.\n\nLloyds Bank notes it\u2019s great to see manufacturers \u2018navigating economic challenges\u2019. Britain is in a better place than the European Union, where manufacturing is going in the opposite direction.\n\nThe electric car revolution and cheaper pricing coming out of China is not helping. It may be satisfying for Brexit supporters to see the EU struggling. But we shouldn\u2019t forget that the EU countries are our biggest trading partner so doldrums on the Continent constrain growth.\n\nAn important indicator of improving conditions is the gentle recovery in the housing market. The Tory calamity in the polls can be traced back to the Liz Truss experiment which sent the cost of mortgages soaring.\n\nThe picture in March painted by the Nationwide is mixed. House prices slipped by 0.2 per cent but are still up 1.6 per cent year on year.\n\nMortgage approvals, a good lead indicator, have been rising with 60,383 new loans put together in February.\n\nOverall, the economy is far from bustling. But trends in inflation, housing and national output suggest an incoming Labour government could reap rewards of growth by just sitting on its hands.\n\nSoho nights\n\nNewYork markets may be the flavour of our times for UK companies. Unless the firm is a tech superstar, such as Arm Holdings, an American listing can be a mixed blessing. Soho House\u2019s New York float in 2021 as Membership Collective Group proved a disaster.\n\nShares have halved with GlassHouse research claiming it faces \u2018an existential crisis\u2019. Executive chairman Ron Burkle argues his group is \u2018fundamentally profitable\u2019.\n\nThe group has 48 clubs in 18 different countries. But it requires a leap to think that start-up clubs in locations such as Nashville will ever acquire the cachet of London.\n\nTaking the group private might provide breathing space to sort out the mess."

      "article_text": "STORY LINK Pound to Euro Rate Edges Above 1.1700 - GBP/EUR Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLike this piece? Please share with your friends and colleagues:\n\nThe Pound to Euro (GBP/EUR) exchange rate has edged back above 1.1700 on Tuesday.UK equity markets have made further gains after the re-opening of domestic markets following the Easter holidays. The PMI data also indicated that UK manufacturing is out-performing the Euro-Zone.The FTSE 100 index briefly broke above the 8,000 level and close to record highs with the firm global tone helping to underpin the Pound.ING noted that the Pound has held firm around 1.17 and commented; \u201cIt is a quiet week for UK data and speakers, but Thursday's final services and composite PMI numbers may prove sterling supportive \u2013 if they are confirmed at strong readings.\u201dAs far as UK data is concerned, Nationwide reported that seasonally-adjusted UK house prices declined 0.2% for March after a 0.7% increase the previous month and compared with consensus forecasts of a 0.4% increase for the month.There was a 1.6% year-on-year increase in prices from 1.2% previously.According to Nationwide's Chief Economist Robert Gardner; \u201cActivity has picked up from the weak levels prevailing towards the end of 2023 but remain relatively subdued by historic standards.\u201dHe maintained a positive overall stance; \u201cWith cost-of-living pressures easing as inflation moves back towards target, consumer sentiment is improving. Moreover, with income growth continuing to outpace house price growth by a healthy margin, housing affordability is improving, albeit gradually.\u201dGardner added; \u201cIf these trends are maintained, activity is likely to gain momentum, though the pace of the recovery is still likely to be heavily influenced by the trajectory of interest rates.\u201dElsewhere in the housing sector, mortgage approvals increased to 60,400 for February from a revised figure of just over 56,000 previously and compared with consensus forecasts of around 57,000.There was also a net increase in mortgage lending for the month.As far as inflation is concerned, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) reported that shop prices increased 1.3% in the year to March from 2.5% previously and the lowest inflation rate since December 2021.Non-food inflation declined to 0.2% while the increase in food prices slowed to 3.7% from 5.0%,BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson, commented; \u201cWhile these figures are good news for consumers, from this month, retailers face significant increased cost pressures that could put progress on bringing down inflation at risk.\u201dThe UK manufacturing PMI index was revised to 50.3 for March from the flash reading of 49.9 and this was the first reading above the 50.0 threshold since July 2022.Business optimism increased to an 11-month high, but selling prices increased for the fifth successive month as input prices increased at the fastest rate for a year.Rob Dobson, Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, commented; \u201cThe end of the first quarter saw UK manufacturing recover from its recent doldrums.\u201dThe Euro-Zone PMI services-sector index was revised to 46.1 for March from the flash reading of 45.7.Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, commented; \"It\u2019s a bit disheartening: over the last eight months, the manufacturing industry has been gradually climbing the Output PMI ladder, but it still finds itself on the basement staircase.\u201dGermn inflation data will be released later in the day with expectations of a slide in the annual rate to 2.2% from 2.5%.The latest US JOLTS job-openings data is due on Tuesday and will be important for European currencies.According to MUFG; \u201cUnless there is significant slowdown in US employment growth, the US dollar is likely to continue to trade on a stronger footing this week to reflect the building risk that the Fed could lag behind European central banks when starting to cut rates.\u201d\n\nInternational Money Transfer?

      "article_text": "After posting sharp losses on Monday with a slide to 6-week lows just below 1.2540, the Pound to Dollar (GBP/USD) exchange rate managed to stabilise on Tuesday and edged higher to around 1.2570 after the latest US data while UK data was also broadly positive.\n\nAccording to Scotiabank; \u201cResistance is 1.2585/90; if sterling can regain a 1.26 handle, additional strength should follow.\u201d\n\nIt will, however, be difficult for the Pound to make headway unless there is a dip in underlying dollar demand.\n\nMUFG commented; \u201cUnless there is significant slowdown in US employment growth, the US dollar is likely to continue to trade on a stronger footing this week to reflect the building risk that the Fed could lag behind European central banks when starting to cut rates.\u201d\n\nUS data releases will continue to be monitored closely with the key employment report due on Friday.\n\nConsensus forecasts for that data are for an increase in non-farm payrolls of just over 200,000 for March with the unemployment rate holding at 3.9%.\n\nThe latest US JOLTS data recorded a marginal increase in job openings to 8.76mn from 8.75mn previously, although the January figure was originally reported at 8.86mn.\n\nDanske Bank expects a further slowdown; \u201cwe expect job openings to trend lower over the coming months, which would pave way for the first rate cut from the Fed.\u201d\n\nStandard Chartered sees the potential for on-going dollar demand; \u201cThere is a possibility that investors keep buying USD because it remains a high-yielder within G10, even if overall yields are falling.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nING remarked; \u201cGiven the direction of travel of the US data recently, it seems hard to expect any renewed dovishness on their side. Any reversal in this dollar strength (if it does come) will have to be data-driven.\u201d\n\nScotiabank noted that gold hit a fresh record high with futures close to $2,300 per ounce on Tuesday and added; \u201cBroadly, history suggests higher gold prices are usually associated with a softer tone in the USD so gold strength and a firm USD look a little odd; something may have to give.\u201d\n\nIf gold does not retreat, the dollar could be vulnerable.\n\nMortgage approvals increased to near 60,400 for February from a revised 56,100 the previous month. This was above consensus forecasts of 57,000 and the strongest reading since October 2022.\n\nJonathan Samuels, CEO of Octane Capital commented; \u201cwe\u2019re now seeing this initial indicator of market health return to levels not seen since 2022, before the market started to cool as a result of higher mortgage rates.\u201d\n\nHe added; \"There\u2019s no doubt buyer confidence has been boosted by the prospect of lower interest rates on the horizon.\u201d\n\nRSM UK economist Thomas Pugh added; \u201cLife may be starting to return to the housing market.\u201d\n\nAshley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, was less confident over the outlook and added that it is \u201cunlikely to continue in the near term\u201d.\n\nHe did, however, expect a fresh surge in mortgage approvals once interest rates are cut.\n\nMarkets are split between the possibility of a BoE rate cut in June or August.\n\nThe UK PMI manufacturing index was also revised to 50.3 for March from the flash reading of 49.9 and this was the strongest reading since October 2022.\n\nRob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics expects a wider boost to spending; \"Consumer caution (is) fading in response to lower interest rates.\" We think households will be willing to spend more this year.\u201d"

      "article_text": "The Shiba Inu project demonstrated significant commitment to reducing the circulating supply of its SHIB token in March.\n\nShibburn tracker in a post on X, revealed that 15,644,329,668 SHIB (approximately $454,154 USD) was removed from circulation through transfers to unusable wallets. This impressive effort increased the monthly SHIB burn rate by 2,330%.\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 15,644,329,668 $SHIB tokens have been burned in the month of March with 217 transactions. #SHIB pic.twitter.com/wCqYDGiZgj \u2014 Shibburn (@shibburn) April 1, 2024\n\nRead Also: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Lead Developer Reiterates Shibarium Launch Date\n\nThe Shiba Inu development team spearheaded the majority of these burns, incinerating a substantial 13,610,153,841 SHIB on March 9th. This initiative aligns with previous efforts; the team destroyed nearly 40 billion SHIB between November and February.\n\nDriving these burns is the Shibarium protocol, which uses a portion of its BONE gas fees to purchase and subsequently burn SHIB tokens. However, recent data from Shibburn indicates a deceleration in daily burns.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the SHIB community managed to destroy just 4,696,071 SHIB, marking a 51.10% decline. It is important to note that while the development team spearheads major burns, the broader SHIB community also plays a role. There are dedicated burn portals and initiatives where individuals can contribute to decreasing the SHIB supply independently.\n\nShibarium Transaction Activity slows down\n\nShibarium, the Shiba Inu-developed Layer-2 solution on the Ethereum blockchain, is experiencing a downturn in transactional activity. On March 31st, the Shibariumscan explorer registered only 3,690 daily transfers, a stark contrast to recent highs of 172,290 transfers and the network\u2019s peak of 2.34 million daily transfers in early March.\n\nDespite the dip in daily transfers, the network continues to register a steady increase in overall transactions \u2013 reaching a cumulative transaction count of 413,159,247 in March. This growth indicates sustained use of the Shibarium network since its launch.\n\nWe are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 \u2014 TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023\n\nRead Also: Shiba Inu Team Confirms Upcoming Massive SHIB Burn\n\n<\n\nMarket Context for SHIB Burns\n\nThe Shiba Inu team is actively working to enhance SHIB\u2019s value by significantly decreasing the token\u2019s circulating supply. Their goal is to create scarcity, which could potentially increase SHIB\u2019s price if demand remains steady. This is a common strategy among cryptocurrency projects aiming for sustained growth, suggesting it might influence SHIB\u2019s future market performance.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"

      "article_text": "The big Cambridge-Oxford boat race on the Thames is the posh British equivalent of March Madness. But there was a big problem this year. The Thames is polluted. The oarsmen had to propel themselves in a sea of e. coli. Unlike the citizens of Flint, MI, who had to face years of polluted water, the oarsmen had a choice. They didn\u2019t have to row. But we are not writing about water equity. This is about utility regulation, and how Americans got something right.\n\nThames Water, the biggest water utility in the UK, was privatized in the last days of the Thatcher regime. The water utilities in the UK at that time faced enormous capital expenditures to bring water supply and waterway pollution up to European standards. The Thatcherites felt it was better to put this financial burden on private suppliers and consumers rather than on the government. These newly privatized utilities would be expected to run more efficiently anyway, and a competitive water market would develop to discipline prices\u2014at least that was the theory. The privatizers ignored a key aspect of the water business. Like other utilities it is extremely capital intensive. This means that cost of capital, largely variable rate interest expense on a highly leveraged capital structure, is one of the biggest items in the water company budget. When they were first privatized this interest expense number that has cannibalized the expense structure was zero. And private investor capital for what is basically a non-investment grade credit costs a lot more than relatively risk free government bond money. But that\u2019s not our topic either. Related: Who Is Behind Iran-Backed Houthi Threats To Attack Saudi Arabia?\n\nThames Water fell into the hands of private equity investors who borrowed heavily to buy Thames. They subsequently paid themselves billions in dividends (effectively as repayment and profit) despite Thames Water\u2019s enormous capital spending needs. Those investors now refuse to put more equity into the utility, which may have to declare bankruptcy (whatever the British equivalent). Or heaven forbid, be renationalized. Where were the British regulators during this debacle? We get the impression that they didn\u2019t think it was cricket to interfere in the private business affairs of the owners. American regulators tend to meddle, however, making it difficult to extract too much from the utility. US regulators take the view that the utility needs to stay healthy, financially, in order to serve the public. And they don\u2019t like to leave that to chance. An ailing (or greedy) corporate parent of an otherwise solid utility will look for ways to extract cash. Don\u2019t make it too easy.\n\nAt the most basic level, a utility has to do three things: raise money at reasonable rates, build large public-serving projects and lastly, to operate these projects effectively. The inability to do any of these three things is or should be disqualifying to a franchise holder. Thames Water says it cannot raise money at reasonable terms, and one might ask if it has built the necessary projects or managed effectively what it operates. One might even argue that Thames is a \u201cdead man walking\u201d, having mismanaged a relatively low risk business to a point apparently beyond financial repair.\n\nOne of these days, Thames Water will be taught as a case study in schools of business and public administration\u2014 a lesson in dogmatism, light-handed regulation, and lack of common sense. Maybe we should be grateful for our clunky US regulators and seemingly inefficient government utilities for plodding along and doing their jobs. Remember, the tortoise won the race.\n\nBy Leonard Hyman and William Tilles for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

      "article_text": "Germany's soccer federation is redesigning its national team's Adidas jerseys after claims that the kits' No. 44 numbering looked similar to a Nazi symbol.\n\nThe German soccer federation (DFB) announced on social media that the organization and its partner, 11teamsports, an online store that sells sports gear, will develop an alternate design for the number 4 after fans spotted similarities between the custom No. 44 jersey and the logo of the Schutzstaffel \u2013 Adolf Hitler's infamous paramilitary force.\n\nJonathan Tah of Germany, who wears No. 4, dribbles during the international friendly match between France and Germany at Groupama Stadium on March 23, 2024 in Lyon, France. Ralf Ibing - firo sportphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB said it was taking the matter \"very seriously\" after people on social media used Adidas' online customization service to make shirts with the number 44 and showed how it resembled the Schutzstaffel's SS symbol, which looks like two lightning bolts. Since no players currently on the men's nor women's soccer roster wear No. 44, the jersey needed to be created using the personalization tool.\n\n\"None of the parties involved saw any proximity to Nazi symbolism in the development process of the jersey design,\" the federation said on X. The DFB said it checks jersey numbers between zero and nine and then submits one through 26 to UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe, for review. The German soccer federation will coordinate with UEFA to make the changes.\n\nAdidas said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday that DFB and 11teamsports \"are responsible\" for the design of the names and numbers. The sports apparel company also told CBS News it's blocking the \"personalization of the jerseys in our online store.\"\n\n\"Our company stands for the promotion of diversity and inclusion, and as a company we actively oppose xenophobia, anti-Semitism, violence, and hatred in any form,\" Adidas said.\n\nGermany debuted its new Adidas jerseys during an international friendly match against France on March 23 at Groupama Stadium in Lyon, France. Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB unveiled the jerseys in March and the men's national team debuted the kits during a match against France. The jerseys will be worn by the team for the 2024 UEFA European championship, which will take place in Germany.\n\nThe controversy around the Adidas jerseys comes as Nike will become Germany's official shirt supplier, beginning in 2027. Adidas had long been part of Germany's soccer teams, having a relationship with the team for around 70 years."

The suspects fled the scene in a vehicle driven by a third male,\" London's Metropolitan Police (the Met) said in a statement.\n\nThe victim in his 30s sustained an injury to his leg in the attack in Wimbledon, southwest London, on Friday afternoon. Police said he has since been discharged from hospital.\n\nEscaping the country after the attack\n\nPolice said that after abandoning the vehicle, the suspects traveled directly to Heathrow Airport and left the United Kingdom a few hours after the attack.\n\nBritain's National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said the victim was British-based Iranian journalist Pouria Zeraati, who hosts a show on the Persian language television news network Iran International, which is critical of Iran's government.

(credit: REUTERS/PAUL CHILDS)\n\nPolice said it remained unclear why the victim was attacked and officers are \"keeping an open mind as to any motivation behind this.\"\n\nThe incident was being investigated by counter-terrorism detectives because the victim was a journalist at a Persian language media organization based in Britain, and previous threats had been directed towards this group of journalists, the Met said.\n\nIn January, Britain imposed sanctions, in coordination with the United States, on Iranian officials it said were involved in threats to kill journalists on British soil, and others it said were part of international criminal gangs linked to Iran."

      "article_text": "British manufacturers have clocked up their first month of growth for nearly two years as the economy bounces back.\n\nIn another sign last year\u2019s recession is firmly over, S&P Global said its index of activity in UK factories rose from 47.5 in February to 50.3 in March.\n\nIt was the first reading over the crucial 50 level that separates growth from decline for 20 months.\n\n\u2018The long downturn in manufacturing output is over,\u2019 said Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nAnalysts believe that cuts to taxes and interest rates will give the economy a further boost as the year goes on.\n\nManufacturing boost: New cars on the production line at the Nissan plant in Sunderland. S&P Global said its index of activity in UK factories rose from 47.5 in February to 50.3 in March\n\nBut with Labour well ahead in the polls, that may not be enough to save the Tories in a general election expected later in 2024.\n\nWhile the UK economy is bouncing back, the eurozone managed a score of just 46.1 as the region took another turn for the worse.\n\nThe region was dragged down by France and Germany which recorded readings of 46.2 and 41.9 respectively.\n\nCyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, described the figures as \u2018disheartening\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector usually runs on several cylinders, mainly the countries of Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\n\nTogether they account for three quarters of the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing industry.\n\n\u2018We have the unusual situation that two cylinders, Germany and France, are more or less out of action. A sustainable economic turnaround can only be expected once all cylinders are back in motion.\u2019\n\nBritain fell into recession at the end of last year as a decline in economic output of 0.1 per cent in the third quarter was followed by another decline of 0..3 per cent in the fourth.\n\nEurope managed to skirt recession, however, though there was no growth across the EU in the third or fourth quarters of last year.\n\nIn the eurozone, output fell 0.1 per cent in the third quarter but was flat in the final three months of 2023, meaning it also avoided recession.\n\nBut while much of Europe continues to struggle \u2013 and in particular Germany \u2013 the recession in the UK is widely seen as over.\n\nHailing the \u2018green shoots of recovery\u2019 in the UK, RSM economist Tom Pugh said the \u2018encouraging\u2019 manufacturing figures \u2018add to evidence that last year\u2019s recession is already over\u2019.\n\nHe said the recession will turn to be \u2018one of the smallest and shortest on record\u2019 and went on: \u2018We expect the economy to gradually pick up steam over the rest of the year as lower inflation, falling interest rates and tax cuts boost consumer spending.\u2019\n\nSeparate figures from Nationwide showed house prices unexpectedly fell 0.2 per cent last month following a 0.7 per cent rise in February.\n\nBut data from the Bank of England showed mortgage lending is at its highest level for 17 months in a sign confidence is returning."

      "article_text": "More than \u00a320billion was wiped off the value of Tesla last night after it reported the first fall in car sales for four years.\n\nThe US electric car maker, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered 386,810 vehicles in the three months to the end of March.\n\nIt was enough for the firm to reclaim its crown as the world\u2019s top seller of electric cars following a slump in sales at Chinese rival BYD.\n\nBut the total was down by more than fifth from the previous quarter and around 9 per cent less than in the same period of 2023.\n\nIt was the first year-on-year fall in sales since 2020 when the business was brought to an effective standstill by Covid-19.\n\nDarker days: Tesla boss Elon Musk has seen the electric car maker's first slump in sales in four years\n\nTesla shares fell more than 5 per cent, wiping \u00a322billion off the value of the company.\n\nThe stock has lost a third of its value this year.\n\nAnalysts branded the update an \u2018unmitigated disaster\u2019 for Tesla and Musk.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been another bad day for Elon Musk,\u2019 said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at broker AJ Bell.\n\nThe total number of cars delivered by Tesla was well below Wall Street expectations of 454,000 amid weakening demand for electric vehicles (EVs). However, Tesla was able to reclaim its crown as the world\u2019s leading EV seller.\n\nBYD, which is backed by Warren Buffett, overtook Tesla in the final quarter of 2023 when it sold 526,409 electric vehicles compared to Tesla\u2019s 484,507.\n\nThis led some analysts to dub the company as the \u2018Tesla Killer\u2019 after it came out on top in a brutal price war in China, a country which builds and buys more electric cars than the rest of the world combined.\n\nIn January Musk warned that Chinese car makers were set to \u2018demolish\u2019 global rivals.\n\nBut BYD\u2019s supremacy over Tesla has proven short-lived.\n\nBYD bosses on Monday revealed the firm delivered just 300,114 EVs in the final quarter of 2024.\n\nBoth Tesla and BYD have suffered as demand for electric cars continues to soften in favour of hybrid or petrol alternatives. Tesla said growth this year would be \u2018notably lower\u2019 than in 2023.\n\nSlowdown: Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the three months to the end of March. Shares fell more than 5%, wiping \u00a322bn off the value of the company\n\nAnd the company cited \u2018shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict\u2019 and an arson attack at its Berlin factory for its slowing production rates.\n\nIt produced just 433,371 vehicles during the quarter \u2013 again far less than the 494,989 that rolled off its assembly lines in the final three months of 2023.\n\nDan Ives, tech analyst at wealth manager Wedbush, said it was a \u2018nightmare quarter for Tesla with [Musk] pressured by the Wall Street and China demand remaining very soft coming out of the gates for 2024\u2019.\n\nDescribing the fall in sales as an \u2018unmitigated disaster\u2019, he added: \u2018This as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black-eye first quarter.\n\nOtherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative.\n\nFor Musk, this is a \u201cfork-in-the-road\u201d time to get Tesla through this turbulent period.\n\nHewson said: \u2018Tesla\u2019s not alone when it comes to waning excitement about the shift to green motoring, as price sensitive consumers are less likely to change ingrained habits.\n\n\u2018This feels more like a bump in the road than a stop light.\u2019"

      "article_text": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has re-upped his post from 1.5 years ago on \u201cLayer 3s\u201d, saying that L3s won\u2019t magically increase throughput. Still, they can reduce certain fixed costs associated with batch publishing and deposits or withdrawals.\n\nHis statement comes amid concerns that Layer 3 networks are taking away from Ethereum\u2019s value and security.\n\nL3 Doesn\u2019t Magically Increase Throughput\n\nAccording to Buterin\u2019s X post, there are alternative, potentially \u201clighter\u201d approaches to achieve similar cost savings as those offered by Layer 3 solutions.\n\nHowever, there are other, potentially \u201clighter\u201d, ways to get the same cost savings that you get from L3s. pic.twitter.com/WTijiTAOE1 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 2, 2024\n\nIn his prior post, Buterin outlined models for Layer 3 solutions. In one of them, Layer 2 is responsible for scaling, while Layer 3 focuses on customizing functionality. While this doesn\u2019t directly enhance scalability, it allows applications to scale through L2s while dissecting layers to meet specific operational requirements for diverse use cases.\n\nThe second model involves Layer 2 scaling for general purposes, with customized scaling handled by Layer 3. This can be achieved through rollups, which optimize data formats for specific applications.\n\nThe third model assigns Layer 2 for trustless scaling and Layer 3 for weekly trusted scaling. Here, Layer 2 focuses on rollups, while Layer 3 incorporates Validiums. They utilize SNARKs for computation verification but rely on a trusted third party for data availability. Despite having lower security levels, Validiums are cost-effective, as pointed out by Buterin.\n\nHe then said that he favored the three-layered blockchain model over the two-layered one, highlighting that the former enables an entire ecosystem to function within one rollup. This setup allows for cross-domain activities across the ecosystem cost-effectively, eliminating the need to bear the expensive costs associated with Layer 1.\n\nLayer 3 Sparks Controversy\n\nWhile some advocate for integrating Layer 3 (L3) networks to enhance Ethereum\u2019s efficiency and functionality, there are concerns among others regarding their potential implications for decentralization and network security.\n\nIn a post on March 31, the Polygon Labs CEO argued that they opted not to develop Layer 3 chains because they were deemed unnecessary and detrimental to Ethereum\u2019s value. He emphasized his belief that Layer 3 networks posed a security threat to Ethereum, illustrating a scenario where all Layer 3s settle on a single Layer 2.\n\nBoiron argued that if Ethereum were to generate minimal fees and lacked prospects for future earnings, its value would diminish. Consequently, validators would lose confidence in holding ETH, leading to decreased network security."

Last week saw a mixed bag for Bitcoin ETFs, with $845 million in inflows overshadowed by previous losses.\n\n\u201cThe carnage isn\u2019t over just yet,\u201d as Grayscale experiences continued withdrawals amid market shifts.\n\nAs Grayscale\u2019s GBTC grapples with a $302 million outflow, the Bitcoin ETF landscape faces challenges, affecting investor confidence and Bitcoin\u2019s price dynamics.\n\nGrayscale GBTC Bears the Brunt of Bitcoin ETF Outflows\n\nDespite a temporary rebound in Bitcoin ETF investments last week, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has not stemmed its outflow tide, losing $302.6 million recently. This downturn has dragged the net flows of Bitcoin ETFs into negative territory at the start of the week, highlighting a persisting trend of capital withdrawal from GBTC amidst broader market hesitations and a shift towards funds with more competitive fees.\n\nMarket Sentiment and Bitcoin Price Impact\n\nThe outflows from GBTC, coupled with investor hesitancy after a dip in cryptocurrency prices, have contributed to a dampened market sentiment. Bitcoin\u2019s price reflects this cautious outlook, with a significant drop to $65,348 per coin following the all-time high of nearly $74,000 in mid-March. This price movement underscores the influence of ETF dynamics on Bitcoin\u2019s market valuation and investor perceptions.\n\nChallenges and Strategic Shifts for Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe recent challenges faced by Bitcoin ETFs, particularly the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, emphasize the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment products. Investors are increasingly seeking alternatives with lower fees, prompting a strategic reassessment for funds like GBTC. The ongoing withdrawals also spotlight the impact of bankrupt crypto companies redeeming shares, further complicating the ecosystem for Bitcoin-focused ETFs.\n\nLooking Ahead: Bitcoin ETFs and Market Recovery\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market navigates through these turbulent waters, the future of Bitcoin ETFs hangs in the balance. The sector\u2019s ability to adapt to investor needs and competitive pressures will be crucial in determining its recovery trajectory. Moreover, the market\u2019s response to regulatory developments and shifts in investment strategies will play a significant role in shaping the path forward for Bitcoin and its associated investment vehicles.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe outflows experienced by Grayscale\u2019s GBTC cast a shadow over the Bitcoin ETF market, reflecting broader concerns about fees, market stability, and the appeal of alternative investment options. As the industry grapples with these challenges, the resilience and adaptability of Bitcoin ETFs will be pivotal in sustaining investor interest and stabilizing Bitcoin\u2019s market presence in the face of uncertainty."

      "article_text": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace during the 2021-2022 bull run, is now in the middle of a transition to a new \u201cOpenSea 2.0\u201d launch with a much leaner team following layoffs last fall. And we\u2019re starting to understand what that will look like as the once-dominant marketplace considers its evolution and next steps.\n\nOn Tuesday, OpenSea announced support for the ERC721-C Ethereum NFT token standard, which was developed by video game startup Limit Break and enables project creators to enforce royalty fee payments on secondary market trades.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest move by OpenSea to adapt to changing tides in NFT royalty enforcement over the last year and a half, as rival marketplaces shunned the once-standard creator fees.\n\nThe marketplace had said in late 2022 that it would continue to enforce royalties following creator pushback and launched a protocol to try and protect royalties on new collections. However, OpenSea ultimately moved away from the operator-filter protocol and sunsetted support for it at the end of February. ERC721-C represents another run at the royalty problem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe're excited to announce that creators can now use ERC721-C from @limitbreak to set and enforce their own creator earnings on OpenSea. What is ERC721-C? ERC721-C is a standard that enables creators to implement programmable and enforceable creator earnings on-chain. It also\u2026 pic.twitter.com/iGAuGsjNid \u2014 OpenSea (@opensea) April 2, 2024\n\nERC721-C support was enabled by the recent launch of OpenSea\u2019s Seaport 1.6 protocol update, CEO and co-founder Devin Finzer told Decrypt, which let creators set conditions before an NFT can be transacted\u2014in this case, honoring royalties.\n\n\u201cGenerally, we've been interested in new ways to support creator earnings,\u201d Finzer said. \u201cSeaport 1.6 was made possible by the Dencun upgrade to Ethereum, so that was something that allowed us to implement this functionality in this particular way.\u201d\n\nOpenSea laid off about half of its staff in November following a dramatic shakeup among NFT marketplaces earlier in the year, as upstart rival Blur overtook OpenSea thanks to incentivizing trades via its own token. An OpenSea representative could not confirm the size of the company\u2019s team by the time of publication.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinzer said that the slimmer company has been reimagining the NFT marketplace experience, with plans to combine the OpenSea and OpenSea Pro platforms into a single interface, develop \u201ca really streamlined and smooth onboarding experience for users,\u201d and to deploy custom interfaces for categories like gaming and ticketing.\n\n\u201cWe're really overhauling the product in a pretty big way,\u201d said Finzer. \u201cSo this means a real visual refresh of the product and an infrastructure refresh.\u201d\n\nThe shift comes at a time in which OpenSea\u2019s market share has faded to a single-digit percentage, with less than 3% of cross-chain trading volume share over the last per data from Tiexo\u2014and under 7% over the past 30 days. The reigning champ of late is Magic Eden, which has launched a rewards program in parallel with an upcoming \u201cNFT\u201d token airdrop.\n\nOpenSea has long resisted the idea of launching its own token, as rivals like Blur and LooksRare have done in the past. It\u2019s been the biggest burning question around the marketplace for years, particularly as competitors have gained steam by debuting their own tokens or rewards programs tied to future token drops.\n\nAsked if he thinks token incentives like that are sustainable, Finzer wouldn\u2019t spill on whether the marketplace will consider creating and dropping its own ecosystem token. But he acknowledged that token incentives are \u201creally exciting\u201d and can be an effective way to align users with the protocols they frequent.\n\n\u201cIn general, across crypto, this idea of having users participate and be incentivized and aligned with applications is really exciting,\u201d Finzer told Decrypt. \u201cAnd that's something that we've seen all over the place in crypto, really since the dawn of Bitcoin and Ethereum is that there's more participation\u2014there's more skin in the game when it comes to usage of crypto products.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that we're just seeing that trend play out more and more across crypto, and it\u2019s really exciting to see.\u201d he added. \u201cBut no, nothing to share on our front with regards to that.\u201d\n\nFinzer offered a similar reply in terms of whether OpenSea plans to support Bitcoin Ordinals, the NFT-like protocol that has helped Magic Eden gain a leg up over all other rivals in recent weeks. He\u2019s intrigued by the way that Ordinals have captured the attention of Bitcoiners, however, but says that recent Ethereum ecosystem developments have also been compelling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo announcement yet on that front either,\u201d Finzer said of the Bitcoin assets. \u201cBut I certainly think that, in general, the Ordinals ecosystem is pretty interesting. It's really engaged the Bitcoin community.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Ordinals trades tend to be higher-value, however, and Finzer said that low-cost transactions via Ethereum layer-2 networks like Base are a bigger focus for OpenSea at the moment.\n\nWith layer-2 fees falling sharply after the Dencun upgrade, they\u2019re seeing sizable demand on Base and expect that scaling networks can better support use cases like gaming. Making it easy to move funds across networks and transact is still a work in progress with layer-2s, he added, but he sees their emergence as a key step in bringing NFTs to the masses.\n\n\u201cGas costs need to go down, right? And the exciting thing is that now they have gone down dramatically. It's just a matter of stitching things together and making the user experience really good for users today,\u201d he said. \u201cOur vision has always been that we need to dramatically lower the costs and scale blockchain so that we can support all sorts of use cases.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

However, on-chain data shows the bulk of the $2 billion in BTC was still \u201cunspent\u201d as of press time.\n\nThe Bitcoin stash held by US authorities was seized in November 2022 from James Zhong. Zhong hacked Silk Road in 2012 and stole 50,000 BTC from the illegal marketplace. U.S. authorities raided a house tied to Zhong in 2021 and found hard wallets containing Bitcoin, including one \u201con a single-board computer that was submerged under blankets in a popcorn tin.\u201d The majority of the seized crypto assets was moved to the same government-controlled wallet that transferred 30,174 BTC earlier today.\n\nThe U.S. authorities have since periodically offloaded the seized BTC; in March, they liquidated 9,861 coins for $215 million. At the time, they said they intended to sell an additional $1.1 billion.\n\nWhat Could It Mean For Bitcoin?\n\nGovernment-owned Bitcoin is always intriguing to crypto enthusiasts. This is because when such gargantuan stashes of Bitcoin get transferred, it has previously caused a slump across all major cryptocurrencies, as pointed out by pundits.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin faced intense selling pressure today, dipping below the $65,000 level for the first time since March 24 amid renewed outflows from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC.\n\nNow, however, traders seem to be unperturbed by renewed concerns of selling pressure from the U.S. authorities, with the premier crypto up 0.1% in the last hour to trade for $66,063 at the time of publication."

      "article_text": "In a move highlighting the growing interest in the stablecoin market, Nick Van Eck, son of investment management veteran Jan Van Eck, is making a significant bet on cryptocurrencies through the family business.\n\nAgora, a startup co-founded by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) manager firm VanEck, along with crypto veterans Drake Evans and Joe McGrady, recently raised $12 million in a seed funding round to launch its USD stablecoin.\n\nVanEck-Backed Agora Enters Stablecoin Space\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, Agora\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by cash, US Treasury bills, and overnight repurchase agreements. It will be managed by VanEck, according to Kyle DaCruz, director of digital assets products at VanEck.\n\nDaCruz emphasized the importance of having audited and transparent stablecoin reserves to ensure transparency and trustworthiness. Agora plans to build this future by partnering with crypto companies, including exchanges, custodians, decentralized applications (dApps), and trading firms, rather than directly targeting customers in different regions.\n\nWhile Tether currently dominates the stablecoin sector, with a market value of around $104 billion, and USDC issued by Circle holds about $32 billion, VanEck believes there is still room for a newcomer.\n\nPer the report, Agora aims to fill this gap by focusing on regions such as Argentina and Southeast Asia, where stablecoins have significantly impacted.\n\nNotably, Agora\u2019s stablecoin will only be available to users outside the United States due to the country\u2019s lack of federal legislation governing stablecoins. VanEck highlighted the importance of regulatory clarity and intended to serve international customers primarily until such legislation is in place.\n\nAgora plans to establish income-sharing contracts with its partners, offering them benefits while individual holders of Agora won\u2019t receive direct yield or income. VanEck also expressed concerns about some projects in the stablecoin sector, particularly in light of the TerraUSD blowup, and emphasized the need to build a company that positively advances the industry.\n\nBitcoin ETF Trading Volume Skyrockets To $111 Billion\n\nIn a significant increase in interest in the newly approved investment vehicles, spot Bitcoin ETFs traded $111 billion in March, nearly tripling February\u2019s total of $42.2 billion.\n\nBloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas took to social media site X (formerly Twitter) and highlighted the significance of this milestone, underlining the substantial growth in trading volume by stating:\n\nBitcoin ETFs traded $111 billion in March, which is just about triple what they did in February and January. I can\u2019t imagine April will be bigger, but who knows.\n\nAmong the spot ETFs available, those issued by Grayscale (GBTC), BlackRock (IBIT), and Fidelity (FBTC) continued to dominate trading volume, as seen in the chart above shared by Eric Balchunas. However, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC fund has experienced total outflows of more than $15 billion since it began trading in January.\n\nThe significant growth in spot Bitcoin ETF trading volume reflects the increasing demand for crypto investment products. As more investors seek exposure to the digital asset market through regulated and easily accessible vehicles, ETFs have gained traction as a popular option.\n\nAt present, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, BTC, is being traded at $65,200, reflecting a significant decline of over 4% within the past 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

      "article_text": "Solana\u2019s DEX trading volume rose to an all-time high in March.\n\nKey momentum indicators showed that demand for SOL continued to rise.\n\nThe monthly trading volume of decentralized exchanges (DEXes) housed within the Solana [SOL] network surpassed $60 billion in March, setting a new high, AMBCrypto noted via DefiLlama\u2019s data.\n\nThis marked a 172% spike from the $22 billion recorded in DEX volume in February.\n\nThe surge in trading volume on Solana\u2019s DEXes in March was due to the significant interest in meme coins on the network during that period.\n\nThis spike in meme coin activity led to a rally in the prices of these assets. For example, the values of meme assets, such as Dogwifhat [WIF], rose by 140% in the last month.\n\nNewer tokens, like Book of Meme [BOME], saw their prices rise 1773% during the same period, per CoinMarketCap\u2019s data.\n\nAs trading activity on Solana DEXes climbed during the 31-day period, total transaction fees and the revenue derived from the same rallied to new highs.\n\nAMBCrypto found that in March, transaction fees received by Solana totaled $69 million. This represented a 431% uptick from the $13 million the network saw in fees in February and a 360% growth year-to-date.\n\nLikewise, according to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Token Terminal\u2019s data, the revenue derived from March\u2019s fees totaled $35 million. This represented a 483% month-over-month (MoM) growth in Solana\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe market continues to demand more SOL\n\nAt press time, the network\u2019s native coin SOL exchanged hands at $185. According to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, the altcoin\u2019s value has grown by 43% in the last month.\n\nLooking to extend its gains, an assessment of key momentum indicators on a 1-day chart revealed an uptick in demand for SOL.\n\nFor example, the coin\u2019s Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) Line \u2014 which measures the flow of money into or out of an asset over a specific period of time \u2014 has trended upward with its price in the past two weeks.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s A/D Line moves in the same direction as its price, it confirms the strength of the price trend. Therefore, when an asset\u2019s price and its A/D Line climb, it signals that buying pressure is increasing.\n\nAlso, SOL\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) rested above their center lines, confirming the market\u2019s preference for coin accumulation over distribution."

      "article_text": "Celestia is making strides to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Celestia has introduced Blobstream. Now Blostream is set to change customizable chains, known as Orbit chains. These chains can be either Layer 2, settling directly to Ethereum, or Layer 3, settling to Arbitrum\u2019s Layer 2, Arbitrum One.\n\nSimplified Data Availability\n\nNow what Blobstream does is uses Celestia\u2019s technology and makes data easily available. A method is used in this process that is called data availability sampling\n\nor (DAS). It makes sure everyone in the network can access transaction and state change data easily.\n\nWith Blobstream, Orbit Chains can now send data to Celestia. This is a big help for developers in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Before, developers found it expensive and complex to make their data easily available. Blobstream makes using DAS easier. It also removes the need for a special group, known as a data availability committee. This group used to be needed to store data and make it available when needed.\n\nImproved Efficiency\n\nIt should be taken into consideration that before Blobstream, Celestia, developers faced many challenges. Celestia Developers had to move to other Layer 1 solutions or form a committee to start their own chain. This was because of limits on how much data could be processed. Celestia has said that Blobstream lets developers continue to work in the Ethereum ecosystem without these problems.\n\nThis solution was created together with Succinct Labs. It uses Succinct Labs\u2019 technology to send information about Celestia\u2019s data to Orbit smart contracts. This makes sure data is available in a way that is both fast and safe.\n\nContinuous Innovation Shown\n\nBlobstream was introduced to the Arbitrum ecosystem after being successfully launched in the Base ecosystem. This shows Celestia\u2019s commitment to improving blockchain technology. It also shows support for developers in different ecosystems.\n\nThe introduction of Blobstream is very important for the future of blockchain. It makes using data availability sampling easier and gets rid of the need for a data availability committee. This means developers can focus more on creating useful applications without worrying about previous challenges.\n\nBlobstream\u2019s integration into the Arbitrum ecosystems huge. It makes data more available, simplifies the development process, and removes old barriers. This helps the Arbitrum ecosystem but and also makes blockchain technology better for developers everywhere. Innovations like Blobstream will be very important as more people start using blockchain technology."

      "article_text": "The dramatic change has become dominant as GoldenTree Asset Management, a literary firm based in the world, recently has put up on sale its cryptocurrency subsidiary, GoldenChain. Another company by the name of Republic is the consumer. This step is like an important shift for GoldenTree which did not involve in the investing of crypto but followed its main focus of credit and distressed market. Republic confirmed the acquisition which witnessed the formation of Republic Digital, the newly named digital asset entity, managed by former GoldenTree partner, Joe Naggar, the CEO and CIO of the newly set up digital asset corporation.\n\nStrategic acquisition increases their leadership in the industry.\n\nThe move of Republic to acquire the major part of GoldenChain is very likely to boost its position in the digital asset arena. One of GoldenChain\u2019s missions is to bring together their expertise and resources into the Republic platform to scale in market reach and explore other business opportunities within the rapidly growing digital asset market space. Andrew Durgee, head of Republic, shared the opinion that the potential for a merger lies in aligning the strongest areas of both in monies. The outcome could become more tempting for a private investor therefore leading to more profitable outcomes.\n\nJoe Naggar is an experienced investment professional with more than two decades of experience, including a significant time slot as Digital Assets at Goldenchain and before that is the former Managing director at Morgan Stanley. He expected to contribute with a backup of his knowledge and experience to Republic Digital. The move comes after the Monmouth University poll showed a conversion of several funders\u2019 donations from cash to digital file by about 9% compared to the 2012 presidential election as well as the recent reports of Naggar\u2019s planned departure from GoldenTree that signal a new chapter in his career focused on Republic\u2019s digital asset initiatives.\n\nGoldenTree\u2019s sale of GoldenChain\n\nThe GoldenChain sale decision by GoldenTree rerouted its systematic evaluation of the merits of the company\u2019s investment in this cryptocurrency field. In virtue of the regulatory and sovereign authority hurdles that the crypto market goes through, GoldenTree reportedly stated that the cryptocurrency hedge fund does not fit the strategy\u2019s investment focus. Joe Naggar stressed that the sale to Republic did not mean a new management for the fund but only changing ownership by alignment and where the fund is able to move in a direction where the growth is best achieved in the digital asset domain.\n\nWhen a verdict was given, the GoldenChain asset portfolio went through an increase from 120 million to 150 million dollars. The deal paves the way for the recovery of direct crypto entity management from GoldenTree, but it will continue to invest in indirect specific subsectors. A supporter of Naggar\u2019s helm at Republic Digital and GoldenTree\u2019s Founder managing partner and Chief Investment Officer Tananbaum stated that the company would remain in the digital asset business now running Republic.\n\nFurther prospects and industry implications.\n\nAcquisition mates a new age for Republic Digital, with several millions of dollars in financing from GoldenTree, arriving with their rich legacy and experience in the digital asset setup. The transition of Republic into RepublicGoldenChain aims to expand Republic\u2019s possibilities, with the two combining their distinctive perspectives on the digital asset arena, as well as the universal vision that Republic is always innovating to improve investment opportunities in digital assets and blockchain technology.\n\nThe move likewise shows a bigger trend of conventional asset management companies weighing their position in the crypto sector which is characterized by the strike and the complexities of their regulatory environments. As the field of the crypto assets industry continues its maturation, strategic alignments such as this acquisition will become an element that shows the way of digital asset management and investment of the future.\n\nThe details of the trade lie beneath the curtain, but the strategic reorganization portrays a very firm stance of both entities to enhance the progress and creation of digital assets."

His statements contribute to the ongoing legal scrutiny following the collapse of TerraUSD in 2022. Curran, once at the forefront of Terraform\u2019s public relations, voiced his frustrations with the company\u2019s operations, specifically citing instances of deception.\n\nTerraform Labs Exposed for Misleading Public Statements\n\nCurran\u2019s tenure at Terraform Labs was marked by ethical dilemmas, beginning with his interest in the crypto sphere. However, his excitement soon turned to dismay. An incident in May 2021 served as a critical point. Terraform UST cryptocurrency momentarily lost its peg to the US dollar. Curran was then directed to mislead the public via a Twitter post, asserting the coin\u2019s stability needed \u201ctime to recalibrate.\u201d He later learned the recovery was due to an intervention by Jump Trading, not natural market forces.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis experience left Curran \u201cfairly angry,\u201d realizing the push to disseminate false information. His testimony aligns with the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) accusations. The SEC alleges Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, engaged in fraudulent activities. The lawsuit points out the false claims regarding UST\u2019s stability and LUNA coins\u2019 usage, drawing investors under pretenses.\n\nInternal Disputes Lead to High-Profile Crypto Exit\n\nCurran detailed the challenges he faced, from internal disputes to dealing with aggressive social media confrontations initiated by Do Kwon. The depegging of Terra\u2018s currency during a flight across the Pacific exemplified the unpredictable crises he managed. These events underscored the precarious nature of his role, where the dissemination of accurate information often clashed with company directives.\n\nThe strain of these ethical conflicts eventually led Curran to depart from Terraform Labs. His departure signals the broader impacts of the company\u2019s practices, affecting not just investors but employees as well. As Curran\u2019s testimony unfolds in court, it paints a picture of a company embroiled in deception and internal turmoil.\n\nThe case against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon continues to unravel, raising significant legal and ethical questions. The testimony of Brian Curran serves as a crucial element, shedding light on the practices within Terraform Labs. As the legal battle progresses, more developments are expected to emerge, providing further insights into the operations of Terraform Labs and its impact on the crypto industry.\n\nRead Also: Bitcoin (BTC) Crash To $200? \u201cI Will Simply Buy More\u201d \u2013 Robert Kiyosaki"

While the prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are clearly on the decline, these analyst comments seem to carry more weight.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Predictions for Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nA popular crypto analyst in the cryptocurrency world has been listing his top price predictions for Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) one after the other regarding the current bull market cycle.\n\nThe analyst named Credible attracted attention by telling his followers on social media platform X that Ethereum will surpass \u201cat least\u201d $10,000. However, he reiterated that Ethereum could realistically rise to $20,000.\n\nHe based this prediction on the gains he expects Bitcoin to see and added:\n\nI think we have a chance to reach a peak near $20,000. It\u2019s quite simple \u2013 I believe BTC can realistically double from our last high of $69,000 \u2013 which means most altcoins will multiply that. For ETH, 3-4 times the previous all-time high takes us to $15,000-$20,000.\n\nWhile all this was happening, Ethereum was trading at $3,271 and had fallen more than 6% in the last 24 hours, causing concern among investors.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Opinion on XRP\n\nCredible also stated in another comment that XRP could surpass the $10 level and pointed out that the altcoin, which centers payment systems, had exceeded Ethereum\u2019s market value in a previous cycle.\n\nThe fact is, with the current circulating supply, $10,000 ETH is equivalent to $20+ XRP. So if you think $10 for XRP is impossible but $10,000 for ETH is realistic, you need to check your biases very quickly.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, XRP was trading at $0.59.\n\nIf we were to make shorter-term price predictions, the analyst indicated that Bitcoin could continue to trade at these price levels for a while longer.\n\nBids are now limiting or trying to limit the price downward, just as demands were previously limiting it upward. However, open interest is increasing, so we should experience a nice surge once we break out of this range.\n\nAs of the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin had fallen sharply to $65,615, causing unease among investors.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained in this article does not constitute investment advice. Investors should be aware that cryptocurrencies carry high volatility and therefore risk, and should conduct their own research."

      "article_text": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to allocate a significant percentage of DAI\u2019s supply to a newly created USDe pool.\n\nThe proposal has sparked backlash from several crypto community members.\n\nUSDe\u2019s novel mechanism and high yield have drawn Terra comparisons.\n\nIn DeFi, yield is the name of the game.\n\nWith yields at one point reaching over 67%, USDe, a \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d offering from Ethena Labs, a firm dedicated to creating a widely adopted would-be stablecoin backed by ETH, is the latest to whet the appetite of high-risk crypto natives. This interest has caught the eye of major investors and industry players, including MakerDAO, the body governing DAI, the largest decentralized dollar stablecoin.\n\nOn Friday, March 29, Spark a Maker SubDAO injected $100 million in DAI liquidity in Morpho Blue, a decentralized lending protocol to allow users to borrow USDe and its staked derivative sUSDe against DAI. In the face of high demand, MakerDAO is now considering expanding its USDe and sUSDe allocation with up to $1 billion worth of DAI. The planned move, however, is attracting significant backlash from some crypto community members.\n\nMakerDAO Feeling USDe FOMO?\n\nIn a Monday, April 1, proposal on the MakerDAO Forum, BA Labs, a DeFi-facing risk assessment firm and key MakerDAO stakeholder, argued that MakerDAO should scale up its USDe allocation by up to $1 billion or about 20% of the current DAI supply, starting with a $600 million infusion, amid strong demand for the USDe pool on Morpho Blue.\n\nSponsored\n\nThe proposal, however, has rubbed several crypto community members the wrong way. Reacting to the news, Aave-Chan Initiative Founder Marc Zeller bashed the proposed move to allocate $1 billion in DAI to the newly launched product as \u201creckless.\u201d Furthermore, Zeller has launched a proposal to remove the option for users to collateralize loans in DAI on Aave, citing fears of a contagion risk.\n\n1B $DAI\n\n\n\n\u2013 minted out of thin air (20% of whole supply)\n\n\n\n-into a non-battle tested protocol\n\n-with zero risk mitigation\n\n-weak oracles in less than a month\n\n-for asset hyper sensible to market conditions\n\n\n\nis the definition of reckless\n\n\n\nWill propose LTV reduction of DAI in Aave today \u2014 Marc \u201cChainsaw\u201d Zeller \ud83d\udc7b \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@lemiscate) April 2, 2024\n\nAvara VP Emilio Frangella mused that MakerDAO risked triggering a \u201cDeFi black swan event\u201d through poor risk management.\n\ni feel like the next defi black swan could be a certain og stablecoin protocol going bonkers on risk management but i really hope i am wrong \u2014 Emilio^ (@The3D_) April 2, 2024\n\nSimilarly, prominent crypto community member \u201cPaperImperium\u201d asserted that the proposal made them \u201creally uncomfortable.\u201d They added, \u201cThis is a breakdown of process & diligence.\u201d\n\nIt is necessary to understand how USDe works to understand these reactions.\n\nHow USDe Works: A Looming Black Swan Risk?\n\nEthena\u2019s USDe is backed by Ethereum. While stablecoins backed by crypto assets are typically overcollateralized to hedge against market volatility, Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar offering employs a different approach that allows users to mint 1 USDe for $1 worth of ETH.\n\nEthena\u2019s approach to offset volatility involves opening short futures positions corresponding to USDe user deposits on centralized exchanges. Through this mechanism, Ethena also generates yield, which it shares with users who agree to lock up their tokens. At the time of writing, this annualized yield is at a mouth-watering 35.4%.\n\nUnsurprisingly, USDe\u2019s unconventional model and significantly high yield have set off alarm bells and drawn Terra UST comparisons. The latter\u2019s collapse erased at least $80 billion in value from the crypto market and is widely seen as the catalyst for the last bear market cycle.\n\nDespite the comparisons, UST and USDe are quite different. Unlike USDe, UST lacked an asset backing and maintained its peg through an algorithmic mint and burn mechanism with LUNA, its sister token.\n\nStill, analysts like \u201cDuo Nine\u201d warn that USDe\u2019s model is unlikely to hold up in a bear market where yields turn negative. Other risks that have been highlighted include counterparty risk, as centralized exchanges used as trading venues by Ethena could collapse.\n\nThese risks are part of why Ethena no longer markets USDe as a stablecoin but as a synthetic dollar.\n\nWhat Could Happen to DAI if USDe Depegs?\n\nDespite the Ethena concerns, Duo Nine has suggested that DAI would be just fine should USDe depeg. This view comes as MakerDAO disclosed in its risk assessment that it could manually liquidate positions and \u201cpull out all available DAI liquidity for pools.\u201d\n\n\"That means, they will be the first to sell USDe and recoup their money should USDe depeg,\" the analyst wrote.\n\nWhile Duo Nine believes DAI itself would be fine in the case of a USDe depeg, he could not express the same view for participants in the DAI-USDe pool on Morpho Blue, suggesting that the same mechanism ensuring DAI\u2019s safety would ultimately be their undoing.\n\n\"They quickly get liquidated. Maker gets their money out first as USDe peg falls.\"\n\nStill, Duo Nine maintained that Ethena would pose a systemic to the broader crypto market should it continue to grow at its current pace, representing a significant percentage of all BTC and ETH futures trades.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDespite the concerns, USDe is likely to continue to grow due to its high yield. At the time of writing, the synthetic dollar boasts a market capitalization of about $1.7 billion.\n\nBeyond the promise of high yields, crypto community members are also interacting with the Ethena protocol to accumulate points to claim airdrops of the protocol\u2019s planned governance token ENA. The firm recently initiated claims for 5% of the total token supply.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nDAI is the largest decentralized stablecoin. MakerDAO\u2019s plans to gain more exposure to the newly launched USDe could have significant implications for DAI and the broader crypto ecosystem.\n\nRead this for more on Ethena:\n\nEthena Labs Opens 750M ENA Airdrop Claims as Token Goes Live\n\nLearn about Vitalik Buterin\u2019s thoughts on Layer 3 solutions:\n\nVitalik Buterin Dispels Layer 3 Hype: \u2018Not a Magic Scaling Fix\u2019"

      "article_text": "Cryptocurrency investors did not see a great start in April, but the LTC price has once again surpassed $107. This positive diverging altcoin is moving in the opposite direction of the general market sentiment. So what is the current situation with Bitcoin prices? What are the current predictions for Litecoin (LTC)? Here are the latest market predictions and LTC commentary.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe first quarter of the year was dazzling, and we saw altcoins led by BTC achieve massive gains. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw nearly $12 billion in inflows. This figure was exclusive of net inflows on cryptocurrency exchanges, and we have all experienced the results together. Bitcoin, which reached an all-time high of $73,777 in March, has now lost some ground.\n\nRisky assets generally rose in the first quarter of 2024. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) increased by 10.2%, marking its best first-quarter performance since 2019, while Bitcoin rallied by approximately 69%. While the 7-month winning streak continues, a significant portion of investors remains cautious with concerns that prices won\u2019t keep rising indefinitely.\n\nIf BTC loses the $60,000 level, it will validate these concerns. More ambitious experts predict we might see a new bottom near $45,000.\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n\nLast year, during the halving period, Litecoin was quite strong. In fact, those wanting to offset losses in other altcoins achieved significant gains with LTC for a while. Recently, however, the application for derivative products for LTC by the Coinbase exchange pushed the price up. This application also certified LTC as a commodity.\n\nIn March, LTC continued its steady rise by reaching higher peaks and had risen to $112 yesterday. Despite subsequent sales, the price rebounded from the $93 support level. We had written this week that the reaction from the $93 support could determine the price direction.\n\nNow, the critical threshold for LTC is $112, and if it can close above this level, it may extend the rally towards $120. On the other hand, closures below $105 could lead to a pullback to the main support levels of $98, $93, and eventually down to $77.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained in this article does not constitute investment advice. Investors should be aware that cryptocurrencies carry high volatility and therefore risk, and should conduct their own research."

      "article_text": "The Shiba Inu project demonstrated significant commitment to reducing the circulating supply of its SHIB token in March.\n\nShibburn tracker in a post on X, revealed that 15,644,329,668 SHIB (approximately $454,154 USD) was removed from circulation through transfers to unusable wallets. This impressive effort increased the monthly SHIB burn rate by 2,330%.\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 15,644,329,668 $SHIB tokens have been burned in the month of March with 217 transactions. #SHIB pic.twitter.com/wCqYDGiZgj \u2014 Shibburn (@shibburn) April 1, 2024\n\nRead Also: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Lead Developer Reiterates Shibarium Launch Date\n\nThe Shiba Inu development team spearheaded the majority of these burns, incinerating a substantial 13,610,153,841 SHIB on March 9th. This initiative aligns with previous efforts; the team destroyed nearly 40 billion SHIB between November and February.\n\nDriving these burns is the Shibarium protocol, which uses a portion of its BONE gas fees to purchase and subsequently burn SHIB tokens. However, recent data from Shibburn indicates a deceleration in daily burns.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the SHIB community managed to destroy just 4,696,071 SHIB, marking a 51.10% decline. It is important to note that while the development team spearheads major burns, the broader SHIB community also plays a role. There are dedicated burn portals and initiatives where individuals can contribute to decreasing the SHIB supply independently.\n\nShibarium Transaction Activity slows down\n\nShibarium, the Shiba Inu-developed Layer-2 solution on the Ethereum blockchain, is experiencing a downturn in transactional activity. On March 31st, the Shibariumscan explorer registered only 3,690 daily transfers, a stark contrast to recent highs of 172,290 transfers and the network\u2019s peak of 2.34 million daily transfers in early March.\n\nDespite the dip in daily transfers, the network continues to register a steady increase in overall transactions \u2013 reaching a cumulative transaction count of 413,159,247 in March. This growth indicates sustained use of the Shibarium network since its launch.\n\nWe are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 \u2014 TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023\n\nRead Also: Shiba Inu Team Confirms Upcoming Massive SHIB Burn\n\n<\n\nMarket Context for SHIB Burns\n\nThe Shiba Inu team is actively working to enhance SHIB\u2019s value by significantly decreasing the token\u2019s circulating supply. Their goal is to create scarcity, which could potentially increase SHIB\u2019s price if demand remains steady. This is a common strategy among cryptocurrency projects aiming for sustained growth, suggesting it might influence SHIB\u2019s future market performance.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"

      "article_text": "Bitcoin registered a slight price decline to trade below $67,000 on Tuesday morning, erasing gains from the previous week. According to data from CoinGecko, the asset is presently trading at $66,139, registering a loss of 4.6% on the day and 6% on the week.\n\nBitcoin registers a significant decline in value\n\nThe entire crypto market followed in the same direction, experiencing a staggering decline of 5.2% to $2.6 trillion, wiping out more than $122 billion from the crypto market. Aside from stablecoins, digital assets in the top 30 according to market cap registered significant losses, with Ethereum registering a 6% drop to trade at $3,331.\n\nHowever, the largest losses in that category were posted by Bitcoin Cash and Aptos, registering losses of 9.9% and 13.5%, respectively. According to data from CoinGlass, the crypto market also witnessed the liquidation of over $426 million in the last 24 hours, with $342 million representing figures from long liquidations.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin was responsible for over $90 million in longs liquidated over the night. This price decline is coming off the back of an impressive performance from the US dollar, with its index (DXY) hitting above 105 for the first time this year. The index is a metric that measures the value of the US dollar against several major currencies, including the euro, yen, and Canadian dollar.\n\nInstitutional presence and the upcoming halving\n\nThe market-wide decline is also coming at a period of increased volatility as the market prepares for the upcoming halving event scheduled to take place in April. In the halving event, miners rewards will be slashed in half, and it is expected to help propel the price of Bitcoin upwards.\n\nHowever, there have been debates about this upcoming halving being priced in, with some analysts noting that it might not produce the expected surge in the price of the asset due to a \u2018crisis of faith\u2019 among investors. The upcoming halving is also coming at a time when Bitcoin has already touched an all-time high, influenced by the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States.\n\nThe drastic fall in supply caused by institutional investors buying up available Bitcoins along with the halving has been credited by analysts as a bullish sign. Moreso, a new Coinbase report has suggested that Q2 could be a rewarding period for the crypto market. According to the crypto exchange, the market could be triggered by the heavy institutional presence in the spot Bitcoin ETF market."

The Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Valores (CNV), Argentina\u2019s securities regulatory authority, announced that virtual asset service providers must comply with the new regulations designed to enhance the country\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) framework.\n\nThis move aligns with the recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and marks a pivotal moment for digital asset services in Argentina.\n\nArgentina adopts global standards with new crypto regulation\n\nArgentina\u2019s Senate passed modifications to the existing legislation targeting money laundering and terrorism financing, thereby paving the way for the implementation of stricter oversight on crypto operations.\n\nThe CNV emphasized that these changes are in line with FATF guidelines, which aim to ensure that virtual asset service providers operate transparently and with accountability. According to CNV President Roberto Silva, unregistered crypto firms will no longer be permitted to function within the country.\n\nThis regulation is part of Argentina\u2019s broader efforts to integrate into the global financial system by adopting internationally recognized standards and practices.\n\nNot that anyone cares but here are some news from Argentina \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised but everyone that felt for the \u201canarcho-capitalist libertarian\u201d leader is\n\n\n\nMilei has now introduced crypto laws and regulations that basically have pushed most crypto wallets out of business \u2014 Nina Lira \ud83d\udd4a Frankfurt \u2022 Paris (@ageofnina) April 2, 2024\n\nImpact on the crypto industry and users\n\nThe requirement for crypto businesses to register with the Argentine government signifies a shift towards more regulated and structured oversight of digital assets in the country. The reforms, which were initiated before the election of President Javier Milei\u2014a known proponent of Bitcoin and digital currencies\u2014have sparked discussions within the crypto community.\n\nThe implementation of FATF\u2019s recommendations has raised concerns about the future of digital assets in Argentina, especially among those who viewed Milei\u2019s presidency as a positive development for the crypto space.\n\nOne of the immediate effects of the new regulations is on the operations of Strike, a custodial Lightning wallet popular among Argentines for facilitating Bitcoin payments. Users have reported that the app no longer supports sending fiat to bank accounts, indicating a direct impact on the availability of certain crypto services in the country. This development underscores the broader implications of the new requirements for businesses operating in the digital asset sector and their customers.\n\nArgentina\u2019s bold move in crypto regulation and national engagement\n\nArgentina\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs even suggested that contracts could be settled using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, highlighting the government\u2019s interest in exploring the potential of digital assets.\n\nDespite these regulatory changes, President Milei continues to engage with the public on various national issues. He recently spoke at a ceremony commemorating Malvinas Day, which honors those who lost their lives during the Falklands War in 1982, demonstrating his ongoing commitment to addressing Argentina\u2019s past and future challenges.\n\nArgentina\u2019s decision to implement registration requirements for cryptocurrency firms represents a critical step towards enhancing the regulatory framework for digital assets within the country. By aligning with FATF recommendations, Argentina aims to combat money laundering and terrorism financing more effectively while fostering a safe and transparent environment for the burgeoning crypto industry.\n\nAs the global landscape for digital currencies continues to evolve, Argentina\u2019s approach to regulation may offer valuable insights for other nations navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency oversight."

S&P Global said its index of activity in UK factories rose from 47.5 in February to 50.3 in March\n\nBut with Labour well ahead in the polls, that may not be enough to save the Tories in a general election expected later in 2024.\n\nWhile the UK economy is bouncing back, the eurozone managed a score of just 46.1 as the region took another turn for the worse.\n\nThe region was dragged down by France and Germany which recorded readings of 46.2 and 41.9 respectively.\n\nCyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, described the figures as \u2018disheartening\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector usually runs on several cylinders, mainly the countries of Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\n\nTogether they account for three quarters of the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing industry.\n\n\u2018We have the unusual situation that two cylinders, Germany and France, are more or less out of action.

      "article_text": "More than \u00a320billion was wiped off the value of Tesla last night after it reported the first fall in car sales for four years.\n\nThe US electric car maker, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered 386,810 vehicles in the three months to the end of March.\n\nIt was enough for the firm to reclaim its crown as the world\u2019s top seller of electric cars following a slump in sales at Chinese rival BYD.\n\nBut the total was down by more than fifth from the previous quarter and around 9 per cent less than in the same period of 2023.\n\nIt was the first year-on-year fall in sales since 2020 when the business was brought to an effective standstill by Covid-19.\n\nDarker days: Tesla boss Elon Musk has seen the electric car maker's first slump in sales in four years\n\nTesla shares fell more than 5 per cent, wiping \u00a322billion off the value of the company.\n\nThe stock has lost a third of its value this year.\n\nAnalysts branded the update an \u2018unmitigated disaster\u2019 for Tesla and Musk.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been another bad day for Elon Musk,\u2019 said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at broker AJ Bell.\n\nThe total number of cars delivered by Tesla was well below Wall Street expectations of 454,000 amid weakening demand for electric vehicles (EVs). However, Tesla was able to reclaim its crown as the world\u2019s leading EV seller.\n\nBYD, which is backed by Warren Buffett, overtook Tesla in the final quarter of 2023 when it sold 526,409 electric vehicles compared to Tesla\u2019s 484,507.\n\nThis led some analysts to dub the company as the \u2018Tesla Killer\u2019 after it came out on top in a brutal price war in China, a country which builds and buys more electric cars than the rest of the world combined.\n\nIn January Musk warned that Chinese car makers were set to \u2018demolish\u2019 global rivals.\n\nBut BYD\u2019s supremacy over Tesla has proven short-lived.\n\nBYD bosses on Monday revealed the firm delivered just 300,114 EVs in the final quarter of 2024.\n\nBoth Tesla and BYD have suffered as demand for electric cars continues to soften in favour of hybrid or petrol alternatives. Tesla said growth this year would be \u2018notably lower\u2019 than in 2023.\n\nSlowdown: Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the three months to the end of March. Shares fell more than 5%, wiping \u00a322bn off the value of the company\n\nAnd the company cited \u2018shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict\u2019 and an arson attack at its Berlin factory for its slowing production rates.\n\nIt produced just 433,371 vehicles during the quarter \u2013 again far less than the 494,989 that rolled off its assembly lines in the final three months of 2023.\n\nDan Ives, tech analyst at wealth manager Wedbush, said it was a \u2018nightmare quarter for Tesla with [Musk] pressured by the Wall Street and China demand remaining very soft coming out of the gates for 2024\u2019.\n\nDescribing the fall in sales as an \u2018unmitigated disaster\u2019, he added: \u2018This as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black-eye first quarter.\n\nOtherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative.\n\nFor Musk, this is a \u201cfork-in-the-road\u201d time to get Tesla through this turbulent period.\n\nHewson said: \u2018Tesla\u2019s not alone when it comes to waning excitement about the shift to green motoring, as price sensitive consumers are less likely to change ingrained habits.\n\n\u2018This feels more like a bump in the road than a stop light.\u2019"

Royal Mail racked up losses of \u00a3319million in the six months to the end of September 2023.\n\nGilthorpe\u2019s appointment came as Royal Mail hiked the price of its stamps.\n\nThe cost of a first-class stamp rose by another 10p yesterday, to \u00a31.35.\n\nSecond class stamps also went up 10p to 85p. The price of a first class stamp has gone up three times in a year \u2013 from 95p to \u00a31.10 in April 2023 and then to \u00a31.25 in October.\n\nIt comes at a critical juncture for Royal Mail as Ofcom is considering its future and the \u2018universal service obligation\u2019 to deliver letters six days a week.\n\nThe industry regulator revealed in a long-awaited report in January that an overhaul could see Royal Mail\u2019s letter delivery service slashed from six days to five \u2013 or even three \u2013 a week.\n\nOfcom has since been consulting on the proposals, with a deadline of today for responses.\n\nIt will report back its findings in the summer.\n\nGilthorpe has worked at Europe\u2019s busiest airport since 2009 and managed Heathrow\u2019s response to pandemic.\n\nShe said: \u2018Royal Mail is a great British brand with a long and proud history.

      "article_text": "Germany's soccer federation is redesigning its national team's Adidas jerseys after claims that the kits' No. 44 numbering looked similar to a Nazi symbol.\n\nThe German soccer federation (DFB) announced on social media that the organization and its partner, 11teamsports, an online store that sells sports gear, will develop an alternate design for the number 4 after fans spotted similarities between the custom No. 44 jersey and the logo of the Schutzstaffel \u2013 Adolf Hitler's infamous paramilitary force.\n\nJonathan Tah of Germany, who wears No. 4, dribbles during the international friendly match between France and Germany at Groupama Stadium on March 23, 2024 in Lyon, France. Ralf Ibing - firo sportphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB said it was taking the matter \"very seriously\" after people on social media used Adidas' online customization service to make shirts with the number 44 and showed how it resembled the Schutzstaffel's SS symbol, which looks like two lightning bolts. Since no players currently on the men's nor women's soccer roster wear No. 44, the jersey needed to be created using the personalization tool.\n\n\"None of the parties involved saw any proximity to Nazi symbolism in the development process of the jersey design,\" the federation said on X. The DFB said it checks jersey numbers between zero and nine and then submits one through 26 to UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe, for review. The German soccer federation will coordinate with UEFA to make the changes.\n\nAdidas said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday that DFB and 11teamsports \"are responsible\" for the design of the names and numbers. The sports apparel company also told CBS News it's blocking the \"personalization of the jerseys in our online store.\"\n\n\"Our company stands for the promotion of diversity and inclusion, and as a company we actively oppose xenophobia, anti-Semitism, violence, and hatred in any form,\" Adidas said.\n\nGermany debuted its new Adidas jerseys during an international friendly match against France on March 23 at Groupama Stadium in Lyon, France. Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB unveiled the jerseys in March and the men's national team debuted the kits during a match against France. The jerseys will be worn by the team for the 2024 UEFA European championship, which will take place in Germany.\n\nThe controversy around the Adidas jerseys comes as Nike will become Germany's official shirt supplier, beginning in 2027. Adidas had long been part of Germany's soccer teams, having a relationship with the team for around 70 years."

(credit: REUTERS/PAUL CHILDS)\n\nPolice said it remained unclear why the victim was attacked and officers are \"keeping an open mind as to any motivation behind this.\"\n\nThe incident was being investigated by counter-terrorism detectives because the victim was a journalist at a Persian language media organization based in Britain, and previous threats had been directed towards this group of journalists, the Met said.\n\nIn January, Britain imposed sanctions, in coordination with the United States, on Iranian officials it said were involved in threats to kill journalists on British soil, and others it said were part of international criminal gangs linked to Iran."

According to data from CoinGecko, the asset is presently trading at $66,139, registering a loss of 4.6% on the day and 6% on the week.\n\nBitcoin registers a significant decline in value\n\nThe entire crypto market followed in the same direction, experiencing a staggering decline of 5.2% to $2.6 trillion, wiping out more than $122 billion from the crypto market. Aside from stablecoins, digital assets in the top 30 according to market cap registered significant losses, with Ethereum registering a 6% drop to trade at $3,331.\n\nHowever, the largest losses in that category were posted by Bitcoin Cash and Aptos, registering losses of 9.9% and 13.5%, respectively. According to data from CoinGlass, the crypto market also witnessed the liquidation of over $426 million in the last 24 hours, with $342 million representing figures from long liquidations.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin was responsible for over $90 million in longs liquidated over the night. This price decline is coming off the back of an impressive performance from the US dollar, with its index (DXY) hitting above 105 for the first time this year. The index is a metric that measures the value of the US dollar against several major currencies, including the euro, yen, and Canadian dollar.\n\nInstitutional presence and the upcoming halving\n\nThe market-wide decline is also coming at a period of increased volatility as the market prepares for the upcoming halving event scheduled to take place in April. In the halving event, miners rewards will be slashed in half, and it is expected to help propel the price of Bitcoin upwards.\n\nHowever, there have been debates about this upcoming halving being priced in, with some analysts noting that it might not produce the expected surge in the price of the asset due to a \u2018crisis of faith\u2019 among investors. The upcoming halving is also coming at a time when Bitcoin has already touched an all-time high, influenced by the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States.\n\nThe drastic fall in supply caused by institutional investors buying up available Bitcoins along with the halving has been credited by analysts as a bullish sign. Moreso, a new Coinbase report has suggested that Q2 could be a rewarding period for the crypto market. According to the crypto exchange, the market could be triggered by the heavy institutional presence in the spot Bitcoin ETF market."

S&P Global said its index of activity in UK factories rose from 47.5 in February to 50.3 in March\n\nBut with Labour well ahead in the polls, that may not be enough to save the Tories in a general election expected later in 2024.\n\nWhile the UK economy is bouncing back, the eurozone managed a score of just 46.1 as the region took another turn for the worse.\n\nThe region was dragged down by France and Germany which recorded readings of 46.2 and 41.9 respectively.\n\nCyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, described the figures as \u2018disheartening\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector usually runs on several cylinders, mainly the countries of Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\n\nTogether they account for three quarters of the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing industry.\n\n\u2018We have the unusual situation that two cylinders, Germany and France, are more or less out of action. A sustainable economic turnaround can only be expected once all cylinders are back in motion.\u2019\n\nBritain fell into recession at the end of last year as a decline in economic output of 0.1 per cent in the third quarter was followed by another decline of 0..3 per cent in the fourth.\n\nEurope managed to skirt recession, however, though there was no growth across the EU in the third or fourth quarters of last year.\n\nIn the eurozone, output fell 0.1 per cent in the third quarter but was flat in the final three months of 2023, meaning it also avoided recession.\n\nBut while much of Europe continues to struggle \u2013 and in particular Germany \u2013 the recession in the UK is widely seen as over.\n\nHailing the \u2018green shoots of recovery\u2019 in the UK, RSM economist Tom Pugh said the \u2018encouraging\u2019 manufacturing figures \u2018add to evidence that last year\u2019s recession is already over\u2019.\n\nHe said the recession will turn to be \u2018one of the smallest and shortest on record\u2019 and went on: \u2018We expect the economy to gradually pick up steam over the rest of the year as lower inflation, falling interest rates and tax cuts boost consumer spending.\u2019\n\nSeparate figures from Nationwide showed house prices unexpectedly fell 0.2 per cent last month following a 0.7 per cent rise in February.\n\nBut data from the Bank of England showed mortgage lending is at its highest level for 17 months in a sign confidence is returning."

      "article_text": "More than \u00a320billion was wiped off the value of Tesla last night after it reported the first fall in car sales for four years.\n\nThe US electric car maker, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered 386,810 vehicles in the three months to the end of March.\n\nIt was enough for the firm to reclaim its crown as the world\u2019s top seller of electric cars following a slump in sales at Chinese rival BYD.\n\nBut the total was down by more than fifth from the previous quarter and around 9 per cent less than in the same period of 2023.\n\nIt was the first year-on-year fall in sales since 2020 when the business was brought to an effective standstill by Covid-19.\n\nDarker days: Tesla boss Elon Musk has seen the electric car maker's first slump in sales in four years\n\nTesla shares fell more than 5 per cent, wiping \u00a322billion off the value of the company.\n\nThe stock has lost a third of its value this year.\n\nAnalysts branded the update an \u2018unmitigated disaster\u2019 for Tesla and Musk.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been another bad day for Elon Musk,\u2019 said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at broker AJ Bell.\n\nThe total number of cars delivered by Tesla was well below Wall Street expectations of 454,000 amid weakening demand for electric vehicles (EVs). However, Tesla was able to reclaim its crown as the world\u2019s leading EV seller.\n\nBYD, which is backed by Warren Buffett, overtook Tesla in the final quarter of 2023 when it sold 526,409 electric vehicles compared to Tesla\u2019s 484,507.\n\nThis led some analysts to dub the company as the \u2018Tesla Killer\u2019 after it came out on top in a brutal price war in China, a country which builds and buys more electric cars than the rest of the world combined.\n\nIn January Musk warned that Chinese car makers were set to \u2018demolish\u2019 global rivals.\n\nBut BYD\u2019s supremacy over Tesla has proven short-lived.\n\nBYD bosses on Monday revealed the firm delivered just 300,114 EVs in the final quarter of 2024.\n\nBoth Tesla and BYD have suffered as demand for electric cars continues to soften in favour of hybrid or petrol alternatives. Tesla said growth this year would be \u2018notably lower\u2019 than in 2023.\n\nSlowdown: Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the three months to the end of March. Shares fell more than 5%, wiping \u00a322bn off the value of the company\n\nAnd the company cited \u2018shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict\u2019 and an arson attack at its Berlin factory for its slowing production rates.\n\nIt produced just 433,371 vehicles during the quarter \u2013 again far less than the 494,989 that rolled off its assembly lines in the final three months of 2023.\n\nDan Ives, tech analyst at wealth manager Wedbush, said it was a \u2018nightmare quarter for Tesla with [Musk] pressured by the Wall Street and China demand remaining very soft coming out of the gates for 2024\u2019.\n\nDescribing the fall in sales as an \u2018unmitigated disaster\u2019, he added: \u2018This as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black-eye first quarter.\n\nOtherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative.\n\nFor Musk, this is a \u201cfork-in-the-road\u201d time to get Tesla through this turbulent period.\n\nHewson said: \u2018Tesla\u2019s not alone when it comes to waning excitement about the shift to green motoring, as price sensitive consumers are less likely to change ingrained habits.\n\n\u2018This feels more like a bump in the road than a stop light.\u2019"

We are thoroughly looking into it, are in contact with the governments [of the foreigners among the dead] and will do everything to ensure it does not happen again,\u201d Mr Netanyahu said in a video message.\n\nThe convoy \u2013 consisting of two armoured cars branded with the WCK logo and a soft-skin vehicle \u2013 was hit as it was leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, where the team had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian food aid taken to Gaza on the maritime route, the aid group said.\n\nThe \u201cunforgivable\u201d attack came despite the charity coordinating on its movements with the Israeli military along approved routes, said WCK, which was founded by Spanish-American celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s. He described the aid workers as \u201cangels\u201d and said he was \u201cheartbroken and grieving for their families and friends\u201d.\n\nThe charity announced it has suspended its activities in the region.\n\nThe bodies were taken to al-Aqsa hospital, some of them wearing protective gear with the logo of World Central Kitchen charity, The Independent understands. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said the operation to recover the seven bodies took \u201cseveral hours\u201d.\n\nOne of the destroyed cars pictured along Al Rashid road (EPA/MOHAMMED SABER)\n\nThe Israeli military hit the convoy three times with a drone as the aid workers tried to dive for cover between the vehicles and drive those wounded to safety, security sources told Haaretz.\n\nExpressing the \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the aid workers\u2019 bereaved families, the IDF insisted it was \u201creviewing the incident at the highest levels\u201d and said it would be \u201cinvestigated in the Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism: an independent, professional, and expert body\u201d.\n\n\u201cLast night, an incident took place in Gaza that resulted in the tragic death of World Central Kitchen employees as they fulfilled their vital mission of bringing food to people in need,\u201d an IDF spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cAs a professional military committed to international law, we are committed to examining our operations thoroughly and transparently. I just spoke to WCK Founder, Chef Jose Anders, and expressed the deepest condolences of the Israel Defence Forces to the families and the entire World Central Kitchen family.\n\n\u201cWe also express sincere sorrow to our allied nations who have been doing and continue to do so much to assist those in need. We will be opening a probe to examine this serious incident further. This will help us reduce the risk of such an event from occurring again.\u201d\n\nAustralian national, Zomi Frankcom, 43, was the first of the seven to be named. Former WCK chief executive Nate Mook, who first hired Ms Frankcom, described her to The Independent as a \u201cshining star\u201d and \u201cgift to the world\u201d.\n\nZomi Frankcom was described as a \u2018gift to the world\u2019 (The Independent)\n\nMs Frankcom was interviewed by this publication just three weeks before she was killed, from a Jordanian military base where she was coordinating the delivery of humanitarian aid via airdrops.\n\nPolish citizen Damian Sobol, 35, has also been named as among the dead. He started volunteering with WCK at the outset of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, to help feed refugees in the border town of Przemysl, before joining the charity\u2019s response to the earthquakes in Turkey and then in Gaza.\n\nLord David Cameron said the UK\u2019s Foreign Office was \u201cworking to verify\u201d reports that British nationals were among the aid workers killed, adding that the government wanted \u201ca full, transparent explanation of what happened\u201d.\n\nSenior Tory MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, also demanded a \u201cthorough and swift\u201d investigation.\n\nShe added: \u201cThere is also still no explanation for the bombing of the Medical Aid for Palestine complex in a safe zone, which had also been deconflicted directly with the IDF in January, which four British doctors fortunately survived. Humanitarian agencies must be given the assurances they need that their people will be protected.\u201d\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for international law to be upheld as he described the deaths as \u201coutrageous and unacceptable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe condemn this strike,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be a full investigation and those responsible must be held to account. Humanitarian workers put their lives in danger to serve others. Their deaths are outrageous and unacceptable \u2013 and it is not the first time aid workers have come under fire in Israel\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nDavid Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, said the organisation \u201cgrieves with [WCK] at the senseless loss\u201d, adding: \u201c[Aid workers\u2019] protection is a legal and moral right for civilians and the aid workers there to help them.\n\n\u201cThe war in Gaza has cost too many lives.

      "article_text": "Germany's soccer federation is redesigning its national team's Adidas jerseys after claims that the kits' No. 44 numbering looked similar to a Nazi symbol.\n\nThe German soccer federation (DFB) announced on social media that the organization and its partner, 11teamsports, an online store that sells sports gear, will develop an alternate design for the number 4 after fans spotted similarities between the custom No. 44 jersey and the logo of the Schutzstaffel \u2013 Adolf Hitler's infamous paramilitary force.\n\nJonathan Tah of Germany, who wears No. 4, dribbles during the international friendly match between France and Germany at Groupama Stadium on March 23, 2024 in Lyon, France. Ralf Ibing - firo sportphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB said it was taking the matter \"very seriously\" after people on social media used Adidas' online customization service to make shirts with the number 44 and showed how it resembled the Schutzstaffel's SS symbol, which looks like two lightning bolts. Since no players currently on the men's nor women's soccer roster wear No. 44, the jersey needed to be created using the personalization tool.\n\n\"None of the parties involved saw any proximity to Nazi symbolism in the development process of the jersey design,\" the federation said on X. The DFB said it checks jersey numbers between zero and nine and then submits one through 26 to UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe, for review. The German soccer federation will coordinate with UEFA to make the changes.\n\nAdidas said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday that DFB and 11teamsports \"are responsible\" for the design of the names and numbers. The sports apparel company also told CBS News it's blocking the \"personalization of the jerseys in our online store.\"\n\n\"Our company stands for the promotion of diversity and inclusion, and as a company we actively oppose xenophobia, anti-Semitism, violence, and hatred in any form,\" Adidas said.\n\nGermany debuted its new Adidas jerseys during an international friendly match against France on March 23 at Groupama Stadium in Lyon, France. Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB unveiled the jerseys in March and the men's national team debuted the kits during a match against France. The jerseys will be worn by the team for the 2024 UEFA European championship, which will take place in Germany.\n\nThe controversy around the Adidas jerseys comes as Nike will become Germany's official shirt supplier, beginning in 2027. Adidas had long been part of Germany's soccer teams, having a relationship with the team for around 70 years."

The suspects fled the scene in a vehicle driven by a third male,\" London's Metropolitan Police (the Met) said in a statement.\n\nThe victim in his 30s sustained an injury to his leg in the attack in Wimbledon, southwest London, on Friday afternoon. Police said he has since been discharged from hospital.\n\nEscaping the country after the attack\n\nPolice said that after abandoning the vehicle, the suspects traveled directly to Heathrow Airport and left the United Kingdom a few hours after the attack.\n\nBritain's National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said the victim was British-based Iranian journalist Pouria Zeraati, who hosts a show on the Persian language television news network Iran International, which is critical of Iran's government.

(credit: REUTERS/PAUL CHILDS)\n\nPolice said it remained unclear why the victim was attacked and officers are \"keeping an open mind as to any motivation behind this.\"\n\nThe incident was being investigated by counter-terrorism detectives because the victim was a journalist at a Persian language media organization based in Britain, and previous threats had been directed towards this group of journalists, the Met said.\n\nIn January, Britain imposed sanctions, in coordination with the United States, on Iranian officials it said were involved in threats to kill journalists on British soil, and others it said were part of international criminal gangs linked to Iran."

As a result, out-of-date, misconfigured or unpatched websites that are susceptible to a cyberattack may exist unbeknownst to ACF in its computing environment.\"\n\n\"This could lead to unauthorized modifications and execution of systems commands to compromise sensitive data, including personally identifiable information such as unaccompanied children's records. In addition, the ability to detect a threat or indicator of compromise from those components may be limited, potentially allowing a bad actor to gain a foothold on the network and compromise or attack other components.\"\n\nHHS OIG also found that although ACF had implemented some security controls to protect its cloud information systems, \"it did not effectively implement several other security controls to protect its cloud information systems in accordance with federal requirements and guidelines,\" the report said.\n\nOverall, HHS OIG said it found 19 security controls for ACF cloud information systems that need to be improved to comply with federal requirements. \"During our testing, we were able to exploit certain vulnerabilities to gain additional system privileges to access sensitive data and obtain unauthorized control of cloud components. The most critical findings were related to unintended exposure of sensitive information and a lack of effective input validation on public web sites.\"\n\nHHS OIG said ACF did not perform adequate cloud and web application technical testing techniques against its systems to proactively identify the vulnerabilities that the audit discovered. \"As a result, ACF data hosted in certain systems may potentially be at a high risk of compromise,\" the report says.\n\n\"Failure to accurately inventory cloud assets and implement robust security controls not only jeopardizes sensitive data but also undermines public trust in the agency's ability to safeguard vital information,\" HHS OIG said in a separate statement about the report.\n\nThe potential compromise of ACF data underscores the critical importance of addressing these vulnerabilities promptly and effectively, HHS OIG said.\n\n\"As custodians of sensitive data, ensuring the integrity and security of information systems is paramount for governmental agencies. This report serves as a clarion call, emphasizing the imperative for proactive measures to fortify cybersecurity defenses and mitigate risks posed by evolving threats,\" HHS OIG said.\n\nACF uses cloud service models to process, store or transmit certain ACF mission-related information, according to HHS OIG. During the audit, ACF hosted approximately 62% of its information systems with cloud service providers.\n\nIn a Feb. 15 correspondence included in the report, ACF said it agrees with HHS OIG's five recommendations to mitigate the security weaknesses and that it has already begun to address some of the issues raised by the watchdog agency.\n\nHHS OIG's recommendations to ACF are:\n\nUpdate and maintain a complete and accurate inventory of information systems hosted in the cloud. Remediate the 19 security control findings in accordance with NIST SP 800-53. Update its cloud security procedures to include detailed steps for operational staff to effectively implement cloud security baselines in accordance with HHS requirements. Leverage cloud security assessment tools to identify misconfigurations and weak cybersecurity controls in its cloud infrastructure. Conduct testing of its cloud information systems that includes the emulation of an adversary's tactics and techniques on a defined reoccurring basis.\n\nACF did not immediately respond to Information Security Media Group's request for comment on the report."

The Palestine Red Crescent Society said the operation to recover the seven bodies took \u201cseveral hours\u201d.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the destroyed cars pictured along Al Rashid road (EPA/MOHAMMED SABER)\n\nThe Israeli military hit the convoy three times with a drone as the aid workers tried to dive for cover between the vehicles and drive those wounded to safety, security sources told Haaretz.\n\nExpressing the \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the aid workers\u2019 bereaved families, the IDF insisted it was \u201creviewing the incident at the highest levels\u201d and said it would be \u201cinvestigated in the Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism: an independent, professional, and expert body\u201d.\n\n\u201cLast night, an incident took place in Gaza that resulted in the tragic death of World Central Kitchen employees as they fulfilled their vital mission of bringing food to people in need,\u201d an IDF spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cAs a professional military committed to international law, we are committed to examining our operations thoroughly and transparently. I just spoke to WCK Founder, Chef Jose Anders, and expressed the deepest condolences of the Israel Defence Forces to the families and the entire World Central Kitchen family.\n\n\u201cWe also express sincere sorrow to our allied nations who have been doing and continue to do so much to assist those in need. We will be opening a probe to examine this serious incident further. This will help us reduce the risk of such an event from occurring again.\u201d\n\nAustralian national, Zomi Frankcom, 43, was the first of the seven to be named. Former WCK chief executive Nate Mook, who first hired Ms Frankcom, described her to The Independent as a \u201cshining star\u201d and \u201cgift to the world\u201d.\n\nZomi Frankcom was described as a \u2018gift to the world\u2019 (The Independent)\n\nMs Frankcom was interviewed by this publication just three weeks before she was killed, from a Jordanian military base where she was coordinating the delivery of humanitarian aid via airdrops.\n\nPolish citizen Damian Sobol, 35, has also been named as among the dead. He started volunteering with WCK at the outset of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, to help feed refugees in the border town of Przemysl, before joining the charity\u2019s response to the earthquakes in Turkey and then in Gaza.\n\nLord David Cameron said the UK\u2019s Foreign Office was \u201cworking to verify\u201d reports that British nationals were among the aid workers killed, adding that the government wanted \u201ca full, transparent explanation of what happened\u201d.\n\nSenior Tory MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, also demanded a \u201cthorough and swift\u201d investigation.\n\nShe added: \u201cThere is also still no explanation for the bombing of the Medical Aid for Palestine complex in a safe zone, which had also been deconflicted directly with the IDF in January, which four British doctors fortunately survived. Humanitarian agencies must be given the assurances they need that their people will be protected.\u201d\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for international law to be upheld as he described the deaths as \u201coutrageous and unacceptable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe condemn this strike,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be a full investigation and those responsible must be held to account. Humanitarian workers put their lives in danger to serve others. Their deaths are outrageous and unacceptable \u2013 and it is not the first time aid workers have come under fire in Israel\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nDavid Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, said the organisation \u201cgrieves with [WCK] at the senseless loss\u201d, adding: \u201c[Aid workers\u2019] protection is a legal and moral right for civilians and the aid workers there to help them.\n\n\u201cThe war in Gaza has cost too many lives. We call not just for safety and aid flows but for a sustained ceasefire.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies"

Ralf Ibing - firo sportphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB said it was taking the matter \"very seriously\" after people on social media used Adidas' online customization service to make shirts with the number 44 and showed how it resembled the Schutzstaffel's SS symbol, which looks like two lightning bolts. Since no players currently on the men's nor women's soccer roster wear No. 44, the jersey needed to be created using the personalization tool.\n\n\"None of the parties involved saw any proximity to Nazi symbolism in the development process of the jersey design,\" the federation said on X. The DFB said it checks jersey numbers between zero and nine and then submits one through 26 to UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe, for review. The German soccer federation will coordinate with UEFA to make the changes.\n\nAdidas said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday that DFB and 11teamsports \"are responsible\" for the design of the names and numbers. The sports apparel company also told CBS News it's blocking the \"personalization of the jerseys in our online store.\"\n\n\"Our company stands for the promotion of diversity and inclusion, and as a company we actively oppose xenophobia, anti-Semitism, violence, and hatred in any form,\" Adidas said.\n\nGermany debuted its new Adidas jerseys during an international friendly match against France on March 23 at Groupama Stadium in Lyon, France. Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB unveiled the jerseys in March and the men's national team debuted the kits during a match against France. The jerseys will be worn by the team for the 2024 UEFA European championship, which will take place in Germany.\n\nThe controversy around the Adidas jerseys comes as Nike will become Germany's official shirt supplier, beginning in 2027. Adidas had long been part of Germany's soccer teams, having a relationship with the team for around 70 years."

In addition to covering cloud computing costs, the program will also foot the bill for using large AI models made by other companies, including Meta, Mistral AI, and Cohere \u2014 but notably not the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. It\u2019s just the latest tell that the AI arms race runs hand-in-hand with Big Tech\u2019s fight for cloud dominance.\n\nCloud Burst\n\nAWS has been Amazon\u2019s profit whale for years, and it currently has the market share edge over Microsoft\u2019s cloud business, Microsoft Azure. That status quo could be in danger of tipping. In February, CNBC reported that Azure is growing much faster than AWS, with analysts largely pointing to Microsoft\u2019s AI offerings \u2014 not only is the company heavily invested in OpenAI, it has also integrated AI tech into Azure and kitted out its data centers with heavy-duty GPUs capable of handling the large amounts of computing power needed to run AI models.\n\nLast week Amazon invested $2.75 billion in AI startup Anthropic following a $1.25 billion investment in September, so both Amazon and Microsoft have picked their respective horses for AI software \u2014 albeit Microsoft had a considerable head start. Through its free credit announcement, Amazon is going for some fairly old-school vertical integration:\n\nThe free credits are being offered through a platform called Amazon Bedrock, which farms out large AI models to whoever wants to use them.\n\nHoward Wright, vice president and global head of startups at AWS, told Reuters that the new credits would drive revenue towards Anthropic, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s part of the ecosystem building. We are unapologetic about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is part of the strategy of the major cloud hyperscalers as part of their AI land grab efforts,\u201d Sid Nag, vice president for cloud services and technologies at Gartner Research, told The Daily Upside.\n\nStart \u2018Em Up: Nag added that startups are prime candidates for AWS to get a bigger toehold further down the line. \u201cEven if 10 percent of these startups become major technology players (kind of like the venture capital business model) in the future using the Hyperscalers/AWS\u2019s AI offerings including a variety of LLM providers including Anthropic \u2014 it has the potential for being big business for these cloud hyperscalers like Amazon/AWS,\u201d Nag said. He noted that Google had adopted a similar strategy reeling startups into its cloud business (a distant third to AWS and Azure in terms of market share) long before the generative AI hype train left the station."

      "article_text": "At first, the YouTube videos look like scenes from Nickelodeon\u2019s popular \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d cartoon.\n\nSpongeBob, the title cheery yellow character, appears outside his pineapple-shaped home, while Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob\u2019s cranky boss, is at the Krusty Krab restaurant he runs. But unlike in the show, the characters in the videos aren\u2019t singing jolly songs about life in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Instead, they\u2019re rapping about drugs and guns.\n\nThe mastermind behind the raps is an artist named Glorb. Their music, which has been streamed millions of times on Spotify and YouTube, appears to use artificial intelligence to replicate the iconic characters\u2019 voices.\n\nAs AI tools continue to evolve rapidly, it has become easier for artists like Glorb to make music using generative AI \u2014 and become successful in their own right. However, experts who focus on AI and music said questions surrounding copyright and ownership still linger as a new era of technology dawns in the music industry.\n\n\u201cIt opens up so many more possibilities for someone, you know, to essentially have, like, a fan fiction version of a song because they love the artist,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, an associate professor and the director of the School of Media Arts & Studies at the Ohio University Scripps College of Communication.\n\nThe SpongeBob-inspired tracks have turned Glorb \u2014 who keeps their identity anonymous \u2014 into an online sensation. On Spotify, Glorb averages just under a million listeners a month \u2014 their most popular song, \u201cThe Bottom 2,\u201d has amassed more than 11 million streams. The artist\u2019s music videos, which feature character models from the show, have also racked up millions of views on YouTube.\n\nA SpongeBob character model appears in Glorb's music video \"EUGENE,\" animated by ThrillDaWill. Glorb / ThrillDaWill via YouTube\n\nGlorb, who declined to be interviewed, isn\u2019t publicly affiliated with Nickelodeon. A spokesperson for the Paramount-owned network didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives for YouTube and Spotify also didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe music industry could see an influx of artists who use some kind of AI, especially as technology continues to advance, said Tracy Chan, the CEO of Splash, a generative AI music company. Already, generative AI music programs like Suno, which allows users to enter prompts and generate songs based on the text suggestions, have been hailed as the ChatGPT of music.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we figure out how to both, as an industry \u2026 how do you kind of balance that we\u2019re creating more and more content, which is ultimately good, but also kind of rewarding the folks that are, you know, kind of the source material, so to speak,\u201d Chan said.\n\nGlorb isn\u2019t the first to use the technology to create original music. In some cases, major artists have been involved with AI renditions of their work.\n\nIn June, Paul McCartney announced The Beatles would release one final record, \u201cNow and Then,\u201d using AI technology to extract the voice of the late John Lennon. The singer Grimes, a champion of AI, released elf.tech, a platform on which artists can use an AI replication of Grimes\u2019 voice in their music. The terms of the agreement include that Grimes receives part of the royalties earned from any music that includes the AI version of her voice.\n\nBut in other instances, AI-generated music using artists\u2019 work has sparked some concerns from those in the music industry.\n\nIn April 2023, an artist named Ghostwriter went viral for the track \u201cheart on my sleeve,\u201d which used AI voice replications of the rapper Drake and the singer The Weeknd. The song was quickly removed from several platforms, including YouTube, where a message read: \u201cThis video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Universal Music Group.\u201d\n\nShortly before the Ghostwriter song circulated online, UMG (which has no relationship to NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News) had urged streaming services to prohibit AI programs from using its copyrighted music to train themselves.\n\n\u201cWe have a moral and commercial responsibility to our artists to work to prevent the unauthorized use of their music and to stop platforms from ingesting content that violates the rights of artists and other creators,\u201d UMG, which is considered one of the so-called Big Three global music companies, said in a statement to The Financial Times. \u201cWe expect our platform partners will want to prevent their services from being used in ways that harm artists.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem stems from the fact that music streaming platforms have few tools to detect and track how much AI music is on their apps, Chan said.\n\nThere is an extreme generative remix culture that we are just beginning to enter into. \u2014 Josh Antonuccio, director of the School of Media Arts & Studies at the Ohio University Scripps College of Communication\n\nHe compared traditionally created music to a fingerprint \u2014 streaming platforms can compare other songs against that fingerprint, and when they find a track that matches it, they can assess the upload and remove it if necessary. AI-generated music doesn\u2019t have that hypothetical fingerprint. Therefore, it\u2019s much harder to track and remove.\n\nBecause there is limited technology to track AI music uploaded to various platforms, it\u2019s hard to know how much of it is out there, Chan said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe that it exists, but, again, is it reaching mass consumption? Probably not yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause once it kind of hits the culture, so to speak, that\u2019s where I think kind of a lot of the rights holders like labels and such [will] take action against those platforms and ask them to take it down.\u201d\n\nLawmakers are already beginning to consider how to regulate AI-generated voices in music.\n\nLast month, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed the Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security Act \u2014 also known as the \u201cELVIS Act.\u201d The law, which claims to be the first of its kind, \u201cbuild[s] upon existing state rule protecting against the unauthorized use of someone\u2019s likeness by adding \u2018voice\u2019 to the realm it protects,\u201d Lee\u2019s office said in a news release in January.\n\nMany in the industry, including the Recording Academy and Warner Music Group CEO Robert Kyncl, praised the legislation.\n\nAntonuccio, the Ohio University associate professor, said a wave of technology-infused music should both excite and frighten the industry and consumers.\n\nEven if more laws are introduced, Antonuccio said, trying to curb the tsunami of content that uses generative AI voices will remain almost impossible.\n\n\u201cThere is an extreme generative remix culture that we are just beginning to enter into,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think there are some exciting parts of that, but frankly, I think there\u2019s, there\u2019s many things that should concern all of us with that.\u201d"

      "article_text": "\"We must protect against the predatory use of AI to steal professional artists' voices and likenesses, violate creators' rights, and destroy the music ecosystem,\" read the letter, submitted by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance.\n\nNEW YORK - Hundreds of artists and songwriters including Billie Eilish, Smokey Robinson and the estate of Frank Sinatra signed an open letter released Tuesday urging protections against what they called an \"assault on human creativity\" posed by artificial intelligence.\n\n\"We must protect against the predatory use of AI to steal professional artists' voices and likenesses, violate creators' rights, and destroy the music ecosystem,\" read the letter, submitted by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance.\n\nThe letter comes after months of similar warnings that unchecked artificial intelligence could undermine copyright law and open the door to rampant fraud and theft.\n\n\"We call on all digital music platforms and music-based services to pledge that they will not develop or deploy AI music-generation technology, content, or tools that undermine or replace the human artistry of songwriters and artists or deny us fair compensation for our work,\" read the letter, whose signatories also included Katy Perry, J Balvin and Pearl Jam.\n\n\"Unchecked, AI will set in motion a race to the bottom that will degrade the value of our work and prevent us from being fairly compensated for it,\" read the letter.\n\nLast month, the state of Tennessee -- one of the music industry's nerve centers thanks to Nashville -- became the first in the United States to pass legislation that aims to protect music industry professionals against AI threats with its \"ELVIS Act.\"\n\nThe Ensuring Likeness, Voice, and Image Security Act, which goes into effect on July 1, says generative AI tools cannot replicate an artist's voice without obtaining consent.\n\nSimilar legislation is under discussion at the federal level in Congress, and in several other states.\n\nActivists and top industry organizations including the Recording Industry Association of America and the Screen Actors Guild praised the Tennessee act -- the Human Artistry Campaign, a global coalition, called it \"landmark\" legislation.\n\nIn Tuesday's letter, the Artists Rights Alliance -- an artist-run group representing songwriters and performers -- acknowledged that AI has \"enormous potential to advance human creativity,\" but warned of the darker consequences.\n\n\"Working musicians are already struggling to make ends meet in the streaming world, and now they have the added burden of trying to compete with a deluge of AI-generated noise,\" said ARA head Jen Jacobsen.\n\nUniversal Music Group has cited TikTok's approach to AI as a factor in the ongoing contract renewal feud between the two companies, which has led to music from Universal's many recording artists and those with publishing contracts being expunged from the platform. \u2014 Agence France-Presse"

Building on that, Microsoft just added new bonuses to its Copilot in Microsoft 365 subscription.\n\nAlso: Yahoo leaps toward AI-powered news with Artifact acquisition\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft announced two significant updates for Copilot for Microsoft 365 users: priority access to GPT-4 Turbo and unlimited conversations -- doing away with limits on the number of chats per day and turns.\n\nZDNET previously put GPT-4 Turbo to the test and found that GPT-4 Turbo offers performance that's superior to GPT-4, a win for enterprise customers.\n\nFuthermore, the combination of priority access to GPT-4 Turbo and unlimited conversations should enable users to receive faster and more comprehensive responses when using Copilot in the web or work context, according to Microsoft.\n\nWeb context refers to when Copilot is grounded in the latest information on the web, whereas Copilot in work context refers to when Copilot grounds responses in work data, including calendar, emails, chats, documents, and more. Both benefit from enterprise-grade data protection.\n\nMicrosoft also announced that starting next month it will increase the number of image generation boosts per day in its AI image generator, Microsoft Designer, from 15 to 100, which should reduce the wait times for image creation.\n\nAlso: From Billie Eilish to Stevie Wonder, hundreds of musicians condemn AI's 'assault on human creativity'\n\nThe company said that the new capabilities will be available first on the Copilot website, followed by the Copilot app, Windows, Edge and Microsoft 365.

While I\u2019m sure that a few well-meaning authors out there may be using these tools to simply speed up their workflows, there are significantly more bad actors who are turning to AI to create content instead of hiring writers.\n\nFor every painstaking original work, there are a dozen near-copies that were automatically digested, rewritten, and republished by a machine. Google Search, somehow seeming to not know any better \u2013 or worse, not care \u2013 happily surfaces these reproductions, affording them equal standing and therefore equal viewership, though that\u2019s supposed to change.\n\nEven our personal communications are not immune to the influence of AI. Need a cover letter? Ask ChatGPT or Gemini. Having trouble with an email? Gmail has \u201cHelp me write.\u201d Not sure how to continue a friendly conversation? Google Messages offers contextual \u201cMagic Compose.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, AI has become just as infectious on the reader\u2019s end. Rather than actually reading what someone has written, Google and others have made it possible to \u201cGenerate\u201d an AI summary of an article within seconds.\n\nThe end result is that AI is generating a veritable firehose of online content that is simply being read and digested by another AI. Summaries become word vomit only to be turned back into summaries once more.\n\nAt its core, writing is all about communication. It\u2019s people sharing their knowledge and ideas with other people. Writing is also about building a connection with one another, even people who lived centuries apart.\n\nThe question I\u2019m left to ponder is: When did we stop talking to each other?\n\nSomewhere along the way, we stopped valuing what our fellow human beings had to say. The mantra of \u201ctoo long; didn\u2019t read\u201d has progressed to the point that AI is now handling both the reading and the writing for us, turning the written word into a bizarre and impersonal game of telephone.\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have a silver bullet to solve these problems.

      "article_text": "Professional job-seekers are having a tougher time in today\u2019s market\u2014it\u2019s taking longer to get hired or even get a callback since the heady days of the post-pandemic Great Resignation, while large employers are open about their desire to cut costs, including among formerly insulated executives and middle managers.\n\nBut in a still-booming economy where consumers are going strong, companies can\u2019t avoid hiring humans to meet increased demand. And now Indeed, the biggest job-searching site, is calling on AI to make that job easier.\n\n\u201cIt takes more than 50-plus days\u2014you heard me right, 50-plus days\u2014on average, to hire for a role,\u201d Rajatish Mukherjee, executive vice president and the head of Indeed\u2019s employer-facing division, told reporters this week, unveiling the company\u2019s new offering that promises to use AI for everything from filtering candidates for open jobs to writing outreach messages.\n\n\u201cGone are the days of manually searching and scrolling through a list of applicants,\u201d Mukherjee said.\n\nThe system, dubbed \u201cSmart Sourcing,\u201d is designed to identify active job-seekers (for instance, surfacing candidates who recently updated their profiles and have clicked on job postings); serve up potential matches for job postings, complete with an AI-generated list of highlights demonstrating why a person is a good fit; draft outreach messages; and automate scheduling processes.\n\nEmployers can pay between $1,150 and $3,840 per year to use Smart Sourcing (the lower figure is for occasional hiring). In test runs, Indeed said, employers save six hours a week with Smart Sourcing.\n\nMukherjee has seen the benefits himself, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s taken me like 45 minutes to an hour to craft a really good message to a potential candidate, because I really want them to answer.\u201d\n\nThe technology couldn\u2019t come at a better time, as recruiters\u2014those very employees tasked with sourcing and hiring new employees to grow a company\u2019s ranks\u2014are themselves being cut at an alarming pace. Google, for instance, cut hundreds of recruiting employees in multiple rounds of layoffs last year. Amazon jettisoned many contract recruiters, and Meta\u2019s 11,000 job cuts in 2022 disproportionately affected the recruiting and business divisions. Indeed itself cut 2,200 workers last year, according to CNN.\n\nIndeed has a solution for job-seekers, too, offering an AI tool that will generate a fluid and captivating work-history summary for candidates, while also improving options to apply with a single click.\n\nAlready, 300 million job candidates on Indeed\u2019s platform have agreed to be included in the Smart Sourcing AI tool that will make them visible to companies, Indeed said.\n\nOf course, how well it truly works is yet to be seen.\n\nMukherjee said that the tool has the potential to reduce hiring bias, by focusing on candidates\u2019 actual skills rather than factors like the presence or absence of a college degree, adding that Indeed has a \u201cresponsible AI\u201d team focused on removing bias from the process. But plenty of research has already revealed AI\u2019s potential to supercharge human bias, rather than removing it. Some AI tools that focus on candidates\u2019 body language or expressions can return nonsensical results that have little to do with actual job performance, while comprehensive screening tools can simply bypass qualified candidates altogether, the BBC reported in February. The outlet cited examples of job seekers who were screened out after listing seemingly undesirable hobbies (softball instead of baseball) or putting in a birthdate that made them seem too old.\n\nSome cities and states are moving to regulate AI in the hiring process\u2014Illinois has allowed job seekers to opt out of tools that evaluate their biometrics while New York requires employers using AI decision tools to make sure they are free of bias, and allow potential hires to opt out. But so far, consumer advocates say the laws are weak and poorly enforced."

Government needs to establish ethical frameworks on the development and deployment of AI through data privacy, security, transparency and accountability in AI systems.\n\nAfrica needs to collect more data to have access to its own data and governments need to facilitate data democratisation policies.\n\n\u201cWe really need data that speaks to Africa itself and that case for open data means we are empowering citizens and at the same time encouraging innovation and efficiency and not using data that is inaccurate,\u201d said Miya, emphasising that to host proper data for countries, good cloud infrastructure, including reliable electricity access are important.\n\nSandra Makumbirofa, senior economist, Research ICT Africa, said AI has transformative potential to boost African economies through effective financial inclusion , employment creation and enhanced public service delivery.\n\nHowever, most of the market value of AI was realised in United States and China, she said, citing research by UNCTAD. It was therefore important for African countries to actively participate in global fora to ensure their interests were represented.\n\n\u201cOur database is inadequate for global policy making,\u201d Ms Makumbirofa noted. \u201cThe data that we have as African countries is not represented in the training of AI models.\n\n\u201cThis means that the AI that we are using in Africa from foreign countries does not necessarily have the African context and therefore we are not able to use them efficiently as we can.\u201d\n\nContributing to the discussion, which was moderated by Dorothy Ooko, Head of Communications and Public Affairs for Africa at Google, the UNECA executive secretary, Claver Gatete, highlighted that most people were not aware of AI and a drawback of AI was its dependence on data which has to be accurate.\n\nMr Gatete said the development of infrastructure such as internet connectivity was key to tapping the benefits of AI and that the technology must be shared among countries to avoid inventing the wheel.\n\n\u201cOut of the 1.6 billion people who are not connected, Africa really is one of the biggest places where we are not connected. If you are not connected you cannot even talk about AI. We need infrastructure, we need energy investment going hand in hand with the IT infrastructure,\u201d said Mr Gatete. \u2014 Africa Renewal"

      "article_text": "President Joe Biden greets China\u2019s President Xi Jinping in Woodside, Calif., on Nov, 15, 2023, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative conference. Biden and Xi spoke Tuesday, May 2, 2024, in their first call since their November meeting. (Doug Mills/The New York Times /Pool)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed Taiwan, artificial intelligence and security issues Tuesday in a call meant to demonstrate a return to regular leader-to-leader dialogue between the two powers.\n\nThe call, described by the White House as \u201ccandid and constructive,\u201d was the leaders\u2019 first conversation since their November summit in California produced renewed ties between the two nations\u2019 militaries and a promise of enhanced cooperation on stemming the flow of deadly fentanyl and its precursors from China.\n\nXi told Biden that the two countries should adhere to the bottom line of \u201cno clash, no confrontation\u201d as one of the principles for this year.\n\n\u201cWe should prioritize stability, not provoke troubles, not cross lines but maintain the overall stability of China-U.S. relations,\u201d Xi said, according to China Central Television, the state broadcaster.\n\nThe call kicks off several weeks of high-level engagements between the two countries, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen set to travel to China on Thursday and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to follow in the weeks ahead.\n\nBiden has pressed for sustained interactions at all levels of government, believing it is key to keeping competition between the two massive economies and nuclear-armed powers from escalating to direct conflict. While in-person summits take place perhaps once a year, officials said, both Washington and Beijing recognize the value of more frequent engagements between the leaders.\n\nThe two leaders discussed Taiwan ahead of next month\u2019s inauguration of Lai Ching-te, the island\u2019s president-elect, who has vowed to safeguard its de-facto independence from China and further align it with other democracies. Biden reaffirmed the United States\u2019 longstanding \u201cOne China\u201d policy and reiterated that the U.S. opposes any coercive means to bring Taiwan under Beijing\u2019s control. China considers Taiwan a domestic matter and has vigorously protested U.S. support for the island.\n\nTaiwan remains the \u201cfirst red line not to be crossed,\u201d Xi told Biden, and emphasized that Beijing will not tolerate separatist activities by Taiwan\u2019s independence forces as well as \u201cexterior indulgence and support,\u201d which alluded to Washington\u2019s support for the island.\n\nBiden also raised concerns about China\u2019s operations in the South China Sea, including efforts last month to impede the Philippines, which the U.S. is treaty-obligated to defend, from resupplying its forces on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nNext week, Biden will host Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House for a joint summit where China\u2019s influence in the region was set to be top of the agenda.\n\nBiden, in the call with Xi, pressed China to do more to meet its commitments to halt the flow of illegal narcotics and to schedule additional precursor chemicals to prevent their export. The pledge was made at the leaders\u2019 summit held in Woodside, California, last year on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.\n\nAt the November summit, Biden and Xi also agreed that their governments would hold formal talks on the promises and risks of advanced artificial intelligence, which are set to take place in the coming weeks. The pair touched on the issue on Tuesday just two weeks after China and the U.S. joined more than 120 other nations in backing a resolution at the United Nations calling for global safeguards around the emerging technology.\n\nBiden, in the call, reinforced warnings to Xi against interfering in the 2024 elections in the U.S. as well as against continued malicious cyberattacks against critical American infrastructure, according to a senior U.S. administration official who previewed the call on the condition of anonymity.\n\nHe also raised concerns about human rights in China, including Hong Kong\u2019s new restrictive national security law and its treatment of minority groups, and he raised the plight of Americans detained in or barred from leaving China.\n\nThe Democratic president also pressed China over its defense relationship with Russia, which is seeking to rebuild its industrial base as it presses forward with its invasion of Ukraine. And he called on Beijing to wield its influence over North Korea to rein in the isolated and erratic nuclear power.\n\nAs the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies, Biden also raised concerns with Xi over China\u2019s \u201cunfair economic practices,\u201d the official said, and reasserted that the U.S. would take steps to preserve its security and economic interests, including by continuing to limit the transfer of some advanced technology to China.\n\nXi complained that the U.S. has taken more measures to suppress China\u2019s economy, trade and technology in the past several months and that the list of sanctioned Chinese companies has become ever longer, which is \u201cnot de-risking but creating risks,\u201d according to the broadcaster.\n\nYun Sun, director of the China program at Stimson Center, said the call \u201cdoes reflect the mutual desire to keep the relationship stable\u201d while the men reiterated their longstanding positions on issues of concern.\n\nThe call came ahead of Yellen\u2019s visit to Guangzhou and Beijing for a week of bilateral meetings on the subject with finance leaders from the world\u2019s second largest economy \u2014 including Vice Premier He Lifeng, Chinese Central Bank Gov. Pan Gongsheng, former Vice Premier Liu He, American businesses and local leaders.\n\nAn advisory for the upcoming trip states that Yellen \u201cwill advocate for American workers and businesses to ensure they are treated fairly, including by pressing Chinese counterparts on unfair trade practices.\u201d\n\nIt follows Xi\u2019s meeting in Beijing with U.S. business leaders last week, when he emphasized the mutually beneficial economic ties between the two countries and urged people-to-people exchange to maintain the relationship.\n\nXi told the Americans that the two countries have stayed communicative and \u201cmade progress\u201d on issues such as trade, anti-narcotics and climate change since he met with Biden in November. Last week\u2019s high-profile meeting was seen as Beijing\u2019s effort to stabilize bilateral relations.\n\nAhead of her trip to China, Yellen last week said that Beijing is flooding the market with green energy that \u201cdistorts global prices.\u201d She said she intends to share her beliefs with her counterparts that Beijing\u2019s increased production of solar energy, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries poses risks to productivity and growth to the global economy.\n\nU.S. lawmakers\u2019 renewed angst over Chinese ownership of the popular social media app TikTok has generated new legislation that would ban TikTok if its China-based owner ByteDance doesn\u2019t sell its stakes in the platform within six months of the bill\u2019s enactment.\n\nAs chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews foreign ownership of firms in the U.S., Yellen has ample leeway to determine how the company could remain operating in the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s leaders have set a goal of 5% economic growth this year despite a slowdown exacerbated by troubles in the property sector and the lingering effects of strict anti-virus measures during the COVID-19 pandemic that disrupted travel, logistics, manufacturing and other industries.\n\nChina is the dominant player in batteries for electric vehicles and has a rapidly expanding auto industry that could challenge the world\u2019s established carmakers as it goes global.\n\nThe U.S. last year outlined plans to limit EV buyers from claiming tax credits if they purchase cars containing battery materials from China and other countries that are considered hostile to the United States. Separately, the Department of Commerce launched an investigation into the potential national security risks posed by Chinese car exports to the U.S."

      "article_text": "In an article recently published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers examined the response patterns of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots/large language models (LLMs) to different emotional primes to investigate whether these chatbots elicit human-like response patterns to risk and prosocial behavioral cues.\n\nStudy: Decoding AI's Emotional Intelligence. Image credit: Paper piper/Shutterstock\n\nAI and emotional intelligence\n\nThe investigation of AI\u2019s capabilities has remained one of the top priorities of the scientific community, specifically with the advent of advanced LLMs. Conventionally, studies have primarily focused on investigating cognitive dimensions. A recent study investigated the coding skills, multimodal functionalities, and mathematical prowess, and evaluated the human interaction competencies of generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) -4.\n\nHowever, sufficient studies have not been performed to investigate AI's emotional intelligence. Emotions, which are distinctly human characteristics, can result in a range of behaviors, such as promoting generosity under positive emotional states or risk aversion under negative ones. However, determining whether AI can possess emotions is difficult due to the lack of a clear definition of 'emotion' in the context of AI. Conventionally, human emotions serve dual roles, including interpersonal and intrapersonal roles.\n\nAlthough AI has achieved significant progress in the interpersonal role as the technology can interpret emotional states from different inputs and respond suitably and simulate emotional expressions convincingly across several domains, the ability of AI to match the intrapersonal functions of human emotions has remained underexplored. However, a complete grasp of AI behavior can only be achieved by understanding the extent to which the technology can adjust its responses to emotions/emotional stimuli.\n\nThe study\n\nIn this work, researchers performed two studies, designated as Study 1 and Study 2, to investigate the response patterns of AI chatbots/LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, to different emotional primes. Six different OpenAI ChatGPT Plus accounts with access to both the previous ChatGPT-3.5 model and the latest ChatGPT-4 model were tasked with responding to inquiries concerning prosocial behaviors and investment decisions.\n\nSpecifically, the influence of emotional priming on financial decision-making and prosociality in LLM-generated texts was analyzed in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. Like humans, AI models can also be guided by prompts to perform specific tasks.\n\nThe latest advances in LLMs have enabled them to comprehend natural language and respond to complex questions and instructions involved in psychological experiments. Additionally, the parameter temperature is set by OpenAI to regulate how freely the answers can be generated by the bots.\n\nThe temperatures of ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 are currently set to a value between 0/very rigid and 1/very creative, which indicates that answers from various chat sessions differ when the same question is asked to the bots. Thus, these chat sessions can be treated as human participants who answer questions differently and independently.\n\nIn two studies, researchers investigated the response of AI/OpenAI's LLMs to emotionally charged scenarios/scenarios designed to elicit negative, neutral, or positive emotional states following methods similar to human psychological evaluations. The adjustable temperature parameter and the ChatGPT sessions' independence allowed them to simulate different human-like responses.\n\nIn the research design, emotionally evocative prompts were incorporated into dozens of chat sessions. Experimental integrity was preserved by following strict guidelines, including clarity in response interpretation, control for biases, and classical psychological experiment frameworks.\n\nResearchers prevented training data contamination by adapting conventional psychological settings. They also demanded quantifiable, clear responses from the AI, which were either specific choices or numbers from set options, to prevent interpretative ambiguity.\n\nOvert emotional words were not used before the final responses of the chatbot to control bias. Human-to-human studies were performed in parallel to AI experiments under the same conditions to directly compare human and AI emotional responses.\n\nResearch findings\n\nThis work was the first to investigate the responses of AI to emotional cues at the intrapersonal emotion level. The findings demonstrated that AI chatbots could replicate the way human emotions coordinate responses by adjusting their prosocial and financial actions accordingly.\n\nThe ChatGPT-4 bots demonstrated distinct response patterns in both prosocial and risk-taking decisions when primed with negative, neutral, or positive emotions. However, such a phenomenon was less evident in the ChatGPT-3.5 iterations. Specifically, the sensitivity displayed by ChatGPT-4 to emotional priming was consistent with established human behavior, with more pronounced responses being obtained using negative primes.\n\nFor instance, in both Study 1 and Study 2, the ChatGPT-4 chatbots generated significantly different answers compared to the control group when primed with negative emotions, while ChatGPT-4 bots primed with positive emotions displayed only marginal or no significant differences when compared with the control group. However, ChatGPT-3.5 elicited less differentiated responses compared to ChatGPT-4.\n\nThis observation also indicated that more advanced and bigger LLMs like ChatGPT-4 possess an enhanced capacity to modulate responses based on emotional cues compared to previous LLM versions like ChatGPT-3.5. However, the outcomes of the human-to-human studies aligned more closely with the responses of ChatGPT-3.5 instead of ChatGPT-4. Thus, more research is required to address this discrepancy.\n\nTo summarize, the findings of this study demonstrated the feasibility of swaying AI responses by leveraging emotional indicators."

      "article_text": "The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked a heated debate among experts, with some warning that the hype surrounding the technology may be overshadowing genuine scientific advancements.\n\nDeepMind Co-Founder Demis Hassabis recently drew parallels between the current AI frenzy and the cryptocurrency boom, raising concerns about the potential impact on the field\u2019s progress.\n\nThe debate over whether AI is overpromised has significant implications for the commercial landscape as businesses rush to capitalize on the technology\u2019s potential. Observers say striking a balance between enthusiasm and realism will be crucial for the healthy growth of AI-driven commerce.\n\n\u201cWhile generative AI is powerful, it is still only one segment of AI,\u201d Muddu Sudhakar, co-founder and CEO of the generative AI payments platform Aisera, told PYMNTS. \u201cAI encompasses a variety of categories. But with so much attention on generative AI, it means that these areas get neglected and crowded out. It could also limit research, which could mean less innovation.\u201d\n\nInterest in AI is growing. According to the PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cConsumer Interest in Artificial Intelligence,\u201d the average consumer uses around five AI technologies weekly, including web browsing, navigation apps, and online recommendations. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are interested in AI assistants for tasks like booking travel, with AI enhancing the personalization of in-car experiences. These intelligent systems, leveraging generative AI, tailor recommendations to users\u2019 behaviors and preferences far beyond simple list-based suggestions.\n\nAI Hype\n\nHassabis expressed concerns to the Financial Times regarding the surge of investment in generative AI startups and products, likening the frenzy to other speculative bubbles. \u201cThe billions of dollars being poured into generative AI startups and products brings with it a whole attendant bunch of hype and maybe some grifting and some other things that you see in other hyped-up areas, like crypto or whatever,\u201d he said.\n\nSome experts say the hype surrounding AI has reached a fever pitch, with grandiose promises and astronomical investments obscuring the reality of the technology\u2019s current capabilities.\n\nOne of the main issues with AI hype is that it creates unrealistic expectations among the public and investors. When companies make bold claims about their AI-powered products or services, they often fail to deliver on those promises, leading to disappointment and erosion of trust.\n\n\u201cMost people in the AI space have good intentions and don\u2019t want to mislead consumers or users,\u201d Zohar Bronfman, co-founder and CEO of Pecan AI, told PYMNTS. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that they\u2019re working hard to deliver the best AI products they can. What\u2019s been ignored, though, is that generative AI so far just hasn\u2019t provided significant business value. It\u2019s fascinating and powerful, but so far, most business users have come up empty-handed when they try to use it to really drive business impact.\u201d\n\nSudhakar pointed out the excessive investment in large language models (LLMs), suggesting it may overshadow other vital areas of AI research. This focus risks limiting innovation and neglecting emerging technologies that could offer more significant advancements or solutions to pressing challenges in the field.\n\n\u201cHow many of these do we need?\u201d he said. \u201cHow can you really tell which one is better? It\u2019s not clear. This is why I think just a handful of state-of-the-art models will ultimately prevail. That being said, there will be many SLMs [small language models] that address lots of edge cases, but even in this area, many will fade away.\u201d\n\nSudhakar raised a looming issue in AI: the dwindling supply of data necessary to train LLMs. This scarcity, he warned, could become a significant bottleneck in the development and advancement of these models, potentially hindering progress in AI research and applications.\n\n\u201cOne alternative is to use synthetic data,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is an emerging area and could use much more focus.\u201d\n\nSudhakar also highlighted the importance of shifting focus toward what will eventually succeed the current transformer models in AI. Based on a deep learning architecture, transformer models have revolutionized how machines understand and generate human-like text by enabling them to process words about all the other words in a sentence rather than one at a time.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is a powerful model, but it has limitations, such as with hallucinations, which are based on the underlying probabilities.\u201d\n\nReal Benefits of AI?\n\nWhile generative AI gets all the attention, the real workhorses of AI, machine learning techniques for prediction and optimization, aren\u2019t hyped nearly enough, Bronfman said.\n\n\u201cTested and proven machine learning methods can quickly take business data and extract a great deal of value,\u201d he added. \u201cThey may not seem as shiny and new as generative AI, but they definitely shine when they\u2019re integrated into business systems the right way. These recognized methods deserve more attention and investment so businesses can achieve the transformative benefits of AI.\u201d\n\nSome commenters say that the best use of AI might not be for commerce. Ilia Badeev, head of data science at Trevolution Group, told PYMNTS that the significance of employing AI for nonprofit and scientific endeavors receives inadequate attention.\n\n\u201cI would like to see more hype around AI researchers,\u201d he added. \u201cImagine a ScientistGPT that possesses information from all currently existing textbooks and scientific studies and can use it to advance theoretical and practical science.\u201d"

      "article_text": "A recent survey has revealed that CMOs worldwide are optimistic and confident about Gen AI\u2019s future ability to enhance productivity and create competitive advantage. In this op-ed, Joyce Gordon (lead image), head of generative AI at Amperity, explains how to unleash marketing magic using Gen AI.\n\nSeventy per cent are already using Gen AI, and 19 per cent are testing it. The main areas they\u2019re exploring are personalisation (67 per cent), content creation (49 per cent), and market segmentation (41 per cent).\n\nHowever, for many consumer brands, the divide between expectations and reality looms large. Marketers envisioning a seamless, magical customer experience must recognise that AI\u2019s effectiveness depends on high-quality underlying data. Without that, the AI falls flat, leaving marketers grappling with a less-than-magical reality.\n\nAI-powered marketing fail\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what AI-powered marketing with poor data quality could look like. Say I\u2019m a customer of a general sports apparel and outdoor store, and I\u2019m planning my upcoming annual winter ski trip. I\u2019m excited to use the personal shopper AI to give me an easy and customised experience.\n\nI need to fill in some gaps in my ski wardrobe, so I ask the personal shopper AI to suggest some items to purchase. But the AI is creating its responses based on data about me that\u2019s been scattered across the brand\u2019s multiple systems. Without a clear picture of who I am, it asks me for some basic information that it should already know. Slightly annoying\u2026 I\u2019m used to entering my info when I shop online, but I was hoping the AI upgrade to the experience would make things easier for me.\n\nBecause my data is so disconnected, the AI concierge only has an order associated with my name from two years ago, which was actually a gift. Without a full picture of me, this personal shopper AI is unable to generate accurate insights and ends up sharing recommendations that aren\u2019t helpful.\n\nUltimately this subpar experience makes me less excited about purchasing from this brand, and I decide to go elsewhere.\n\nData quality is the culprit behind a disconnected and impersonal generative AI experience\u2014poor data quality = poor customer experience.\n\nAI-powered marketing for the win\n\nNow, let\u2019s revisit this outdoor sports retailer scenario, but imagine that the personal shopper AI is powered by accurate, unified data that has a complete history of my interactions with the brand from the first purchase to the last return.\n\nI enter my first question, and I get a super-personalised and friendly response, already starting to create the experience of a one-on-one connection with a helpful sales associate. It automatically references my shopping history and connects my past purchases to my current shopping needs.\n\nBased on my prompts and responses, the concierge provides a tailored set of recommendations to fill in my ski wardrobe, along with direct links to purchase. The AI is then able to generate sophisticated insights about me as a customer and even make predictions about the types of products I might want to buy based on my past purchases, driving up the likelihood of me purchasing and potentially even expanding my basket to buy additional items.\n\nWithin the experience, I am able to actually use the concierge to order without having to navigate elsewhere. I also know my returns or any future purchases will be incorporated into my profile.\n\nBecause it knew my history and preferences, Generative AI created a super personalised and convenient buying experience for me. This is a brand I will keep returning to for future purchases.\n\nIn other words, when it comes to AI for marketing, better data = better results.\n\nSo, how do you address the data quality challenge, and what could that look like in this new world of AI?\n\nSolving the data quality problem\n\nThe critical first element to powering an effective AI strategy is a unified customer data foundation. The tricky part is that accurately unifying customer data is hard due to its scale and complexity \u2014 most consumers have at least two email addresses, have moved over eleven times in their lifetimes and use an average of five channels (or if they are millennials or Gen Z, it\u2019s actually twelve channels).\n\nMany familiar approaches to unifying customer data are rules-based and use deterministic/fuzzy matching, but these methods are rigid and break down when data doesn\u2019t match perfectly. This, in turn, creates an inaccurate customer profile that can actually miss a huge portion of a customer\u2019s lifetime history with the brand and not account for recent purchases or changes of contact information. A better way to build a unified data foundation actually involves using AI models (a different flavour of AI than generative AI for marketing) to find the connections between data points to tell if they belong to the same person with the same nuance and flexibility of a human but at massive scale.\n\nWhen your customer data tools can use AI to unify every touchpoint in the customer journey from first interaction to last purchase and beyond (loyalty, email, website data, etc\u2026), the result is a comprehensive customer profile that tells you who your customers are and how they interact with your brand.\n\nHow data quality in generative AI drives growth\n\nFor the most part, marketers have access to the same set of generative AI tools. Therefore, the fuel you input will become your differentiator.\n\nData quality to power AI provides benefits in three areas:\n\nCustomer experiences that stand out \u2014 more personalised, creative offers, better customer service interactions, a smoother end-to-end experience, etc.\n\nOperational efficiency gains for your teams \u2014 faster time to market, less manual intervention, better ROI on campaigns, etc.\n\nReduced compute costs \u2014 better-informed AI doesn\u2019t need to go back and forth with the user, which saves on racking up API calls that quickly get expensive\n\nAs generative AI tools for marketing continue to evolve, they bring the promise of getting back to the level of one-to-one personalisation that customers would expect in their favourite stores, but now at a massive scale. That won\u2019t happen on its own, though \u2014 brands need to provide AI tools with accurate customer data to bring the AI magic to life.\n\nThe dos and don\u2019ts of AI in marketing\n\nAI is a helpful sidekick to many industries, especially marketing \u2014 as long as it\u2019s leveraged appropriately.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick \u2018cheat sheet\u2019 to help marketers on their Gen AI journey:\n\nDo:\n\nBe explicit about the specific use cases where you plan to use data and AI and specify the expected outcomes. What results do you expect to achieve?\n\nCarefully evaluate if Gen AI is the most appropriate tool for your specific use case.\n\nPrioritise data quality and comprehensiveness \u2014 establishing a unified customer data foundation is essential for an effective AI strategy.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nRush to implement Gen AI across all areas. Start with a manageable, human-in-the-loop use case, such as generating subject lines."

Before joining Onfido, he helmed Talend, a data management company in San Mateo, California.\n\nSarasina Tuchen is a senior scientist at the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Highly Automated Systems Safety Center of Excellence. Last month she spoke about advanced air mobility at South by Southwest in Austin.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter SIGN UP\n\nThe couple bought the mansion for $16.6 million in 2021, records show. Built in 2009 on 0.6 acres, the 10,900-square-foot house has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and three half-bathrooms, according to property records. The home also has a gym, golf simulator, wine room, pool, 100 feet of oceanfront and has a 70-foot dock on the Intracoastal Waterway, the listing shows.\n\nThe Tuchens moved to Florida during the pandemic and decided to return to California, Carroll confirmed. They listed the mansion for $21.7 million in November, according to Redfin. The sale is the area\u2019s priciest so far this year. In March of last year, an affiliate of a Canadian commercial real estate firm bought an oceanfront mansion for $19.2 million.\n\nCarroll calls Hillsboro Beach a \u201chidden gem\u201d in South Florida\u2019s hot luxury market. While the oceanfront community saw pricey sales pick up during the pandemic boom, few sales have closed since the market cooled. It is less popular with luxury buyers than neighboring communities in Fort Lauderdale and Boca Raton, Carroll said. With prices surging in nearby markets, he expects luxury buyers looking for more oceanfront land at a lower price to home in on Hillsboro\u2019s waterfront estates.\n\n\u201cPeople are a little more value conscious since Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the value is there.\u201d"

The decision followed an open comment period that sought feedback on whether to approve a \u201cPrivacy-Protective Facial Age Estimation\u201d system.\n\nThis system would analyze the geometry of a user\u2019s face to confirm the person is an adult and can access certain content.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: CC0 Public Domain\n\nWater scarcity and the high cost of energy represent the main problems for irrigation communities, which manage water for this end, making it available to agriculture.\n\nIn a context of drought, with a deregulated and changing electricity market, knowing when and how much water crops are going to be irrigated with would allow those who manage them to overcome uncertainty when making decisions and, therefore, guide them towards objectives like economic savings, environmental sustainability, and efficiency. For this, data science and Artificial Intelligence are important resources.\n\nResearchers from the Hydraulics and Irrigation group with the Mar\u00eda de Maeztu Unit of Excellence in the Agronomy Department at the University of C\u00f3rdoba (DAUCO) are working to apply this cutting-edge technology to the field of precision agriculture. An example of this is the HOPE project, which focuses on the development of a holistic precision irrigation model that also involves the application of AI to guide decision-making.\n\nWithin the framework of this effort, prediction models have been developed that would furnish irrigation communities with rigorous estimates of the amount of water that growers will need to meet their crops' needs.\n\nThe latest model developed, and the most accurate to date, makes it possible to predict the actual demand for irrigation water one week ahead and with a margin of error of less than 2%, thus making possible the effective management of resources, all without detracting autonomy from its users.\n\nAccording to researchers Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez, Emilio Camacho, and Juan Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, this advance represents another step in the line of digitization applied to irrigation developed by the AGR 228 \"Hydraulics and Irrigation\" research group. Now, they have applied the revolutionary architecture of Transformer Deep Learning to the field of precision irrigation.\n\nSince its appearance in 2017, this has been implemented in various sectors and is at the root of Artificial Intelligence milestones, such as ChatGPT. The 'Transformer' architecture stands out for its ability to establish long-term relationships in sequential data through what are known as 'attention mechanisms.'\n\nIn the case of irrigation, this data architecture allows a lot of information to be processed simultaneously, delegating the selection and extraction of the information necessary for optimal prediction to its artificial neural network.\n\nDaily data from the irrigation campaigns from 2015 to 2022 in the Zujar Canal's Community of Irrigators in Don Benito (Badajoz) were used to validate the results of this model. In total, more than 1,800 water consumption measurements were used to train the model, combined with data on temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, evapotranspiration, wind speed, humidity, crop types, etc.\n\nThis has reduced the margin of error from previous models from 20% to just 2%. Applied to integrated decision-making support systems, this can be very useful for managers of irrigation communities by offering an accurate forecast of the daily demand for irrigation water for the next seven days in contexts of water scarcity and high energy prices, but also in the framework of a commitment to sustainable resource management.\n\nThe work is published in the journal Computers and Electronics in Agriculture.\n\nMore information: R.

AI will help the country\u2019s largest lender cut costs as processes become more automated, he said.\n\nAboud\u2019s comments reflect how investors everywhere are looking for ways to capitalize on AI, even in markets like Australia, which is dominated by global miners and banks. The savings for CBA may be significant, given how it spent more than A$7 billion ($4.6 billion) on the nation\u2019s biggest banking workforce last fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIf you were to believe that there would be cost out efficiencies through AI initiatives, CBA has historically been the one bank which could be able to capitalize on that first,\u201d he said. In its February earnings statement, the bank said it\u2019s increasing the use of AI tools for its mobile app and in efforts to train staff and hire engineers.\n\nBanks \u201ccould benefit in the next three to five years from artificial intelligence\u201d and should hold up as the Reserve Bank of Australia starts to trim rates from 12-year highs, he said.\n\nHis A$2.6 billion Perpetual Industrial Share Fund holds all of the nation\u2019s big-four banks, though it\u2019s underweight on the sector relative to its benchmark, the S&P/ASX 300 Industrials Accumulation Index.\n\nFinancials make up a third of the fund, which is up 13% this year, beating 88% of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIn the near term, Aboud also sees strength among the country\u2019s lenders in the face of monetary policy easing, with traders betting the RBA will start lowering rates in September. The central bank signaled a further shift toward a neutral stance as minutes of its March meeting showed the board didn\u2019t consider the case to raise interest rates for the first time since May 2022.\n\n\u201cMargins will probably stay stable\u201d as rates decline, he said. \u201cThe probability of bad debts increasing with lower interest rates is probably lower, so they\u2019ll probably do OK in that environment.\u201d\n\nLocal bank chiefs have recently warned of slowing credit growth and cautioned over future profits. CBA\u2019s half-year earnings in February showed margins under pressure from the fiercely contested market for home loans.\n\nThe lender\u2019s shares are up 7.4% this year, trailing peers National Australia Bank Ltd., Westpac Banking Corp. and ANZ Group Holdings Ltd.\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P."

For comparison, Microsoft offers up to $150k in credits for Azure, and Google gives a $350k specifically for AI startups, and $200k for those that don't work with AI.\n\n\"We partner with venture capital firms and startup organizations like the Y Combinator all over the world and those strategic partners receive specific packages tailored to the needs of their portfolio companies,\" an Amazon representative told The Register. This opens up the possibility that Amazon might throw even more credits at future startups.\n\nIn the past three years, AWS says it's given Y Combinator firms over $125 million in free credits. However, the total budget for their AWS giveaway in the past ten years is $6 billion.\n\nAWS credits (including the $500k set aside for Y Combinator firms) can also finally be used on third-party AI models that Amazon Bedrock hosts. One of the most notable is Anthropic, which was just recently injected with $4bn from Amazon itself. Not only will these free credits take a load off of cash-strapped startups, it also boosts the cashflow of Anthropic even more beyond what Amazon has already given it.\n\nThose AWS credits can also be used on models from Meta (which maintains LLaMA), Mistral AI, Stability AI, Cohere, and AI21 Labs.\n\nPreviously, AWS credits couldn't be used to redeem time to use AI models from third parties, and instead startups were billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. This not only limited what AWS credits could be used for, be it $100k or $500k, but also wasn't ideal for those wanting to try out other models.\n\n\"We hope this will allow startups to experiment with these models in the same way they can use their AWS Activate credits to experiment with other AWS services, with little to no upfront costs,\" Amazon opined.\n\nYou know who doesn't like free credits? The FTC, probably\n\nWhile Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and startups probably all like the idea of giving out hundreds of thousands of dollars in runtime for AI workloads, the FTC and similar watchdogs may disagree. The FTC has been probing the three tech giants plus Anthropic and OpenAI (creator of ChatGPT) since January over concerns that these kinds of practices might be anticompetitive. The European Commission similarly launched an inquiry into Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nThis isn't a legal investigation (yet), but merely a \"study\" in the words of Lina Khan, who today serves as the FTC's chairwoman. Khan is likely to be a bit skeptical of Amazon's credit scheme given that in 2017 she wrote an article titled Amazon's Antitrust Paradox published in the Yale Law Journal, in which she argues that Amazon's business model has been able to defy present antitrust laws.\n\nOn the one hand, it might reflect well for Amazon that it works with lots of third parties for AI models, which aren't exclusive to AWS. On the other hand, giving out so many free credits is probably a big issue for the FTC no matter what.\n\nPlus, Amazon has already been hit with an FTC lawsuit over its e-commerce business, making it clear that the consumer watchdog really isn't a big fan of Amazon at all. \u00ae"

      "article_text": "Last week, officials announced that a number of dairy cows across 11 total herds in Texas, Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico have tested positive for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, also known as bird flu. Now, the first human case of bird flu has been confirmed in Texas.\n\nWhereas the livestock are likely to have contracted the virus through contact with birds carrying the strain, the infected person became ill after exposure to sick cows\u2014marking just the second human case of H5N1 in United States history and the first in the Lone Star state.\n\nThe patient is reportedly doing well and being treated with an antiviral drug, according to a statement from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). Eye inflammation\u2014or pink eye\u2014is their only current symptom, and they have been instructed to isolate to prevent further spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which conducted testing to confirm the single case, is not currently pursuing any further tests of humans who may have also been exposed, reports STAT News\u2019 Helen Branswell.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware of reports that any of this individual\u2019s close contacts have developed any symptoms,\u201d Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, tells the publication. \u201cThe fact that there are not other samples cooking right now is reassuring, insofar as that we\u2019re not aware of other individuals who are symptomatic following an exposure to livestock.\u201d\n\nThe CDC remains vigilant in looking for others who report H5N1-like symptoms, though the virus presents no known risk to the public at large. Meanwhile, officials continue to stress that the milk supply is safe.\n\n\u201cThe cattle infections do not present a concern for the commercial milk supply,\u201d per the statement. \u201cDairies are required to destroy or divert milk from any sick cows, plus pasteurization kills avian flu viruses.\u201d\n\nSince avian flu spilled over into mammals, its potential to evolve and infect humans has remained a concerning unknown for scientists. Foxes, raccoons, sea lions, bears, minks and other mammals across the globe have contracted H5N1 and died. But up until last month, many scientists thought that livestock, such as dairy cows and goats, would not be susceptible to the strain. Now, it appears that mammal-to-mammal spread\u2014from cow to cow, and potentially from cow to human\u2014may be more probable than previously assumed.\n\n\u201cHow else could it move so rapidly?\u201d Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch, tells the New York Times\u2019 Emily Anthes and Apoorva Mandavilli. However, it remains possible that each cow independently contracted the virus from a bird, perhaps through contaminated food or water.\n\nOfficials say the virus has shown no signs of evolving in a way that would make it spread easily among humans, per the New York Times.\n\nIn the past 20 years, approximately 900 human cases of avian flu have been reported across 23 countries. Older strains were more aggressive in humans, but recent iterations have generally yielded milder symptoms and less frequent infections. In 2022, the first U.S. human case of the H5N1 strain was confirmed in a Colorado man working on a poultry farm. He reported feeling fatigued and later recovered.\n\nWith the new case, health officials maintain that it is \u201cextremely rare\u201d for the virus to transmit between people, though they continue to approach the situation with caution.\n\n\u201cOn the positive side, it seems like this was a very mild case, and it\u2019s the only case that\u2019s been identified so far,\u201d Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the Center for Pandemic Decision Science at the University of Texas at Austin, tells the Texas Tribune\u2019s Neelam Bohra. \u201cBut at the same time, it seems like there\u2019s quite a bit of this virus that has been detected in cattle populations. Anytime a virus jumps into a new species, especially a rapidly evolving virus like influenza\u2014we need to be approaching it with the utmost caution and vigilance to make sure we really understand the situation.\u201d"

      "article_text": "Germany's soccer federation is redesigning its national team's Adidas jerseys after claims that the kits' No. 44 numbering looked similar to a Nazi symbol.\n\nThe German soccer federation (DFB) announced on social media that the organization and its partner, 11teamsports, an online store that sells sports gear, will develop an alternate design for the number 4 after fans spotted similarities between the custom No. 44 jersey and the logo of the Schutzstaffel \u2013 Adolf Hitler's infamous paramilitary force.\n\nJonathan Tah of Germany, who wears No. 4, dribbles during the international friendly match between France and Germany at Groupama Stadium on March 23, 2024 in Lyon, France. Ralf Ibing - firo sportphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB said it was taking the matter \"very seriously\" after people on social media used Adidas' online customization service to make shirts with the number 44 and showed how it resembled the Schutzstaffel's SS symbol, which looks like two lightning bolts. Since no players currently on the men's nor women's soccer roster wear No. 44, the jersey needed to be created using the personalization tool.\n\n\"None of the parties involved saw any proximity to Nazi symbolism in the development process of the jersey design,\" the federation said on X. The DFB said it checks jersey numbers between zero and nine and then submits one through 26 to UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe, for review. The German soccer federation will coordinate with UEFA to make the changes.\n\nAdidas said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday that DFB and 11teamsports \"are responsible\" for the design of the names and numbers. The sports apparel company also told CBS News it's blocking the \"personalization of the jerseys in our online store.\"\n\n\"Our company stands for the promotion of diversity and inclusion, and as a company we actively oppose xenophobia, anti-Semitism, violence, and hatred in any form,\" Adidas said.\n\nGermany debuted its new Adidas jerseys during an international friendly match against France on March 23 at Groupama Stadium in Lyon, France. Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB unveiled the jerseys in March and the men's national team debuted the kits during a match against France. The jerseys will be worn by the team for the 2024 UEFA European championship, which will take place in Germany.\n\nThe controversy around the Adidas jerseys comes as Nike will become Germany's official shirt supplier, beginning in 2027. Adidas had long been part of Germany's soccer teams, having a relationship with the team for around 70 years."

It was a main sticking point for both the Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA in their respective strikes last year, resulting in seven months of industry upheaval before gains in those areas were made.\n\nIn the music business, AI has become a daily tool especially for independent artists who use it for writing, production and mastering. Grammy organization the Recording Academy in its rule for this past year\u2019s awards placed restrictions on submissions using AI but did not exclude music or creators from working with it."

The ruling will allow plaintiffs to add more representatives to their class action.\n\nThe case hinges on whether Amazon Web Services failed to gather the required informed consent when collecting voice biometrics from callers to financial institution John Hancock, for which it was providing call center services. The bank and Pindrop, which supplied its biometric software, have been removed from the case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nAttorneys for AWS argued in a letter that testimony on behalf of John Hancock shows that the voices of the three named plaintiffs were not analyzed with the biometric software, Law360 reports, rendering their claims meritless.\n\nU.S. Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas rejected that argument on grounds that the issue is not one for summary judgement, but rather a jurisdictional issue that should be considered independently on the way to trial. If the class is inadequate, he writes, \u201cjustice requires the addition of class representatives who lack the characteristics that Defendant argues are problematic.\u201d Discovery remains ongoing, so AWS will still have time to vet the claims of additional class representatives.\n\nBibas ordered all parties to conduct limited discovery by May 17 to establish whether all 12 plaintiffs\u2019 placed calls in Illinois during which they were authenticated by Pindrop\u2019s technology.\n\n\u201cThe challenges and complexities in obtaining the dismissal of biometrics class actions prior to the commencement of costly discovery\u201d is precisely the topic of a Biometric Update guest post by Baker Donelson Of Counsel David J.

      "article_text": "The Federal Trade Commission voted unanimously on Tuesday to reject an application from three software companies looking to install a new parental consent mechanism that would leverage biometric technologies to determine a user\u2019s age.\n\nIn a 4-0 decision made last Friday, commissioners rejected an application submitted in June of 2023 by the Entertainment Software Rating Board; Yoki, a digital identity verification company; and SuperAwesome, a vendor that helps other tech companies comply with parental verification requirements under the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule. The decision followed an open comment period that sought feedback on whether to approve a \u201cPrivacy-Protective Facial Age Estimation\u201d system.\n\nThis system would analyze the geometry of a user\u2019s face to confirm the person is an adult and can access certain content. The FTC confirmed that 354 comments raised concerns with the software\u2019s data collection and storage capabilities, particularly in regards to generating deepfake content, along with other privacy violations.\n\nThe FTC acknowledged Yoti submitted the same biometric facial analytics model to the National Institute of Standards and Technology for an evaluation.\n\n\u201cThe Commission declines to approve the ESRB group\u2019s application at this time,\u201d the decision reads. \u201cThe Commission expects that this report will materially assist the Commission, and the public, in better understanding age verification technologies and the ESRB group\u2019s application.\u201d\n\nDespite NIST\u2019s pending analysis and report, the FTC elected not to \u201cstay\u201d a formal decision to permit time for NIST to complete its review.\n\n\u201cThe Commission does not have sufficient information to indicate that the 90-day timeframe will be adequate to allow the Commission to receive such test results and analyze their impact on the ESRB group\u2019s application,\u201d the decision reads. \u201cTherefore, rather than staying or extending the deadline for the Commission to make a decision on the application, the Commission is declining the application without prejudice to the applicants refiling in the future.\u201d\n\nAdvocacy organizations celebrated the FTC\u2019s decision. Fight for the Future, a digital rights nonprofit, characterized it as a victory for privacy rights.\n\n\u201cBased on a long history of error-ridden facial recognition technologies disproportionately harming people who aren\u2019t affluent, white, and male, we applaud the FTC\u2019s rejection of this facial recognition technology marketed as a tool to verify age,\u201d Campaigns and Communications Director Lia Holland said in a statement. \u201cWith technologies like this, the only winner will ever be the tech corporations. Adults must give up not only their faces to be analyzed and potentially monetized, but also allow the rooms in which their children play and learn to be invaded.\u201d\n\nIn response, the ESRB told Nextgov/FCW that it was disappointed with the FTC\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) declined to either issue a substantive decision or delay further ruling on our pending application for authorization of Privacy-Protective Facial Age Estimation as a verifiable parental consent method under the COPPA Rule,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nESRB added that it remains \u201chopeful\u201d that it\u2019s facial age recognition estimation along with \u201cother innovative technologies\u201d used to gain parental consent will be considered compliant with COPPA in the near future based on previous FTC statements on COPPA provisions."

Google lawsuit, for which the tech giant has agreed to \u201cdestroy or de-identify\u201d the web browsing data it has saved from people utilizing the \u201cIncognito Mode\u201d feature on the Google Chrome browser. Google would be responsible for deleting billions of records and making sure undeletable records are not associated with individual users.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile the proposal was filed in a California federal court on Monday, the lawsuit has been ongoing since 2020. Google is accused of not making users aware of the extent to which their data could still be accessed in Incognito Mode. Users believed Google gave an unclear explanation of the purpose of its private browsing mechanism to illegally track individuals.\n\nThe company disagreed, noting that Google, internet service providers (ISPs), and employers have always been able to potentially view and collect data from your Chrome browser history, even in Incognito Mode.\n\nIn January, journalists found a Canary build of an updated Incognito mode that more clearly spells out the stipulations of what is hidden when you enter the browsing state.\n\nEven so, 136 million Google users stand to benefit from this case if the settlement proposal is approved. Google will have to destroy or de-identify the data it has collected from users browsing under Incognito mode from December 2023 and earlier.\n\nOther stipulations to the agreement include Google agreeing to block third-party cookies by default in Incognito mode. This will prevent the company from being able to track users on third-party websites when they\u2019re supposed to be untraceable.\n\nDespite the $5 billion valuation of the proposal, users will not receive financial damages in this case in exchange for the changes Google is making to its data and policy. However, you can file claims for damages in California state court on their own as per the settlement terms. So far, 50 known claims have been filed.\n\nEditors' Recommendations"

      "article_text": "Why it matters: Apple just released a new Vision Pro feature called \"Spatial Personas.\" Personas are visual representations of users (avatars) and have been available since the headset launched on February 2. So technically, the feature is just an upgrade to the existing tech, but a significant one.\n\nPersonas are avatars that look like their users. In that sense, they are similar to Memojis on iPhone. The primary difference is that Personas look way more lifelike. Users set up the realistic avatar by allowing the Vision Pro to perform a 3D face scan, which it uses to create a digital likeness. The avatar appears in a movable 2D tile during FaceTime calls or other multiuser activities, like SharePlay. The Vision Pro uses AI to sync the avatar to match the user's head, mouth, and hand movements. The effect is like having a floating animated portrait in your session space.\n\nHowever, this new feature eliminates the \"picture frame\" aspect. Since the Persona only has a head, shoulders, and hands, it looks more like a floating ghost rather than an actual person. Despite the apparition-like appearance, it does create a more personal sensation of the other user being in the room. Part of this is due to real-time movement tracking. If users move closer or farther away or even change positions in the room, this is tracked and translated to the virtual space as if they are there. If you don't like that your colleague moved in front of the diagram he is explaining, simply pinch his avatar (\"I'm crushing you\" style) and move it where you want it.\n\nAnother convenient feature is that supported apps are more interactive. A whiteboard app called Freeform has FaceTime support, so if a user opens it, the app opens and syncs with the other people on the call. Using it with standard Personas is limited since they are stuck in their tile. With Spatial Personas users can gesture and point to areas on the board or even interact with it, increasing the illusion of \"being there.\"\n\nApple TV is another app that is Persona-friendly. In this use case, instead of appearing in front of each other, Personas are situated adjacently as if sitting beside each other. The screen floats unobstructed in front of both users, but if they look to their left or right, they can see each other as if they were in the same room.\n\nThe primary drawback of Apple's avatars is that they straddle the uncanny valley. Each Persona accurately reflects the user and looks real, but they still have an unnatural quality. Many users find this off-putting and would rather see a cartoonish Memoji representation. Spatial Personas might even amplify the uncanny valley effect. Fortunately, the 2D tiles are the default so that users can leave the feature off if they choose.\n\nThe feature is currently in public beta and works with up to five users on a call. To activate, start a FaceTime call, then tap the Spatial Persona option. It works for the latest version of visionOS (1.1.1). If your Vision Pro is up-to-date, but you don't see the option for Spatial Personas, try rebooting."

      "article_text": "If the many rumors are true, Apple will announce and start selling the next version of its wildly popular AirPods in 2024. While the details remain thin, here\u2019s what we know (and what we think we know) about the fourth-generation Apple AirPods.\n\nAirPods 4?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious: the name. Keep in mind, we\u2019re talking about the successor to the two AirPods models that Apple sells that do not have active noise cancellation\u2014the AirPods 2 and AirPods 3, or AirPods second- and third-gen as Apple prefers to refer to them. In other words, the non-\u201cpro\u201d version of the AirPods.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nApple tends to be a creature of habit when it comes to product names, so there\u2019s every reason to think that the next version will follow the existing AirPods naming convention and be called AirPods fourth-generation. (Apple uses numbers and really the generation bit as a way to differentiate, but you get the idea.)\n\nAnd since tech publications are also creatures of habit, we and many other outlets will likely refer to them simply as the AirPods 4.\n\nMore than one model?\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman has proven to be one of the most active tech journalists when it comes to covering Apple, and his reporting from 2023 suggested that Apple may decide to release two new AirPods models, not just one.\n\nThe reason, it\u2019s believed, has to do with pricing. Apple continues to sell the AirPods 2 (which launched in 2019) for $129, with the regular, Lightning-only charging case. If you want wireless charging, you have to buy the wireless charging case separately for another $79.\n\nToday, from a purely feature-based point of view, this makes the AirPods 2 one of the most expensive sets of wireless earbuds you can buy.\n\nMeanwhile, the $169 AirPods 3 come with a wirelessly charging case, more on-earbuds controls, IPX4 water protection, and is are compatible with Apple\u2019s head-tracked version of spatial audio.\n\nApple may well decide to replace both the AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 with two versions of the AirPods 4.\n\nBoth likely will benefit from an updated design, and you can expect that Apple will tout improvements to sound quality. However, the more expensive version would likely stick with the existing AirPods 3 pricing and offer features like active noise cancellation that edge it closer to what you get with the AirPods Pro 2. It may even get the AirPods Pro 2\u2019s more powerful H2 chip.\n\nThe more affordable version could offer a similar experience to the current AirPods 3, but with a price that finally gets a set of Apple-made wireless earbuds closer to (or perhaps a dollar under) the magical $100 price. Apple analyst Ming Kuo said this cheaper model will be known as the AirPods Lite.\n\nJeff Pu, another Apple analyst, supports the idea that Apple will sell an AirPods Lite model, saying that 2024 is likely to bring reduced demand for Apple\u2019s existing AirPods models.\n\nApple has had a lot of time to find ways to bring the price of wireless earbuds features down to a more accessible level and still make its famously high profits, and a $100 set of AirPods would likely be a triumph for the company and reverse Pu\u2019s predicted sales downturn.\n\nSamsung, another mobile company that has resisted lowering its wireless earbuds pricing in the past, debuted $100 Samsung Galaxy Buds FE in 2023, and we felt they were an excellent value.\n\nThe least surprising prediction about the AirPods 4 is that their charging case (whether or not it also supports MagSafe and wireless charging) will use a USB-C port instead of Apple\u2019s Lightning.\n\nGiven that Apple has already made the switch to USB-C on the AirPods Pro 2 and on its most recent iPhone (largely due to an E.U. regulation that essentially forced the move), it seems 99% certain that USB-C will become the norm for all AirPods models \u2014 including the second-gen AirPods Max, which is also expected to debut in 2024.\n\nUSB-C not only simplifies the variety and number of cables you need to keep on hand \u2014 it also enables iPhone-based charging of your AirPods if you have a USB-C-equipped iPhone like the iPhone 15. (Or any other modern phone, for that matter.)\n\nAt least one of the new AirPods 4 models (probably the pricier one) is also expected to inherit the AirPods Pro 2\u2019s Find My feature, complete with the built-in speaker.\n\nHealth and more\n\nThe murkiest predictions for the AirPods 4 center around possible new sensors and health tracking. Gurman has said that temperature sensors added to the AirPods would give Apple\u2019s other products, like the Apple Watch and the Apple Health app in iOS, greater accuracy when gauging your body\u2019s state. Small fluctuations could prove useful when providing early detection of illness.\n\nIt\u2019s also expected that Apple will continue to look for ways to improve hearing. A new test within iOS might serve as an alternative to an audiologist visit, giving the AirPods 4 the ability to act as a hearing aid. New regulations have changed the landscape for over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids in the U.S., and Apple wouldn\u2019t be the first non-medical device company to look at ways to enter this growing market.\n\nThe same test could also offer benefits for casual music listening. Many companies now ship wireless earbuds with built-in support for software that compensates for each person\u2019s unique frequency sensitivity. This creates a custom EQ preset that enhances portions of the audible spectrum that may be harder for some to hear.\n\nAnnouncement and availability\n\nGiven that it\u2019s now April, the window of time before Apple\u2019s next scheduled event \u2014 the 2024 WorldWide Developer Conference (WWDC), which is slated for June 10-14 \u2014 is closing fast. This makes it unlikely that Apple will formally announce the next AirPods until that event, at the earliest.\n\nHowever, if history is any guide, Apple is much more likely to wait until September. New AirPods models have traditionally been announced alongside new iPhone models, and these have always received fall debuts, whereas WWDC has typically been reserved for discussions of new software features powered by iOS.\n\nIf a September announcement is indeed in the cards, you can expect that the AirPods 4 will be made available shortly thereafter as Apple ramps up production capacity to meet the all-important 2024 holiday season.\n\nEditors' Recommendations"

We are thoroughly looking into it, are in contact with the governments [of the foreigners among the dead] and will do everything to ensure it does not happen again,\u201d Mr Netanyahu said in a video message.\n\nThe convoy \u2013 consisting of two armoured cars branded with the WCK logo and a soft-skin vehicle \u2013 was hit as it was leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, where the team had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian food aid taken to Gaza on the maritime route, the aid group said.\n\nThe \u201cunforgivable\u201d attack came despite the charity coordinating on its movements with the Israeli military along approved routes, said WCK, which was founded by Spanish-American celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s. He described the aid workers as \u201cangels\u201d and said he was \u201cheartbroken and grieving for their families and friends\u201d.\n\nThe charity announced it has suspended its activities in the region.\n\nThe bodies were taken to al-Aqsa hospital, some of them wearing protective gear with the logo of World Central Kitchen charity, The Independent understands. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said the operation to recover the seven bodies took \u201cseveral hours\u201d.\n\nOne of the destroyed cars pictured along Al Rashid road (EPA/MOHAMMED SABER)\n\nThe Israeli military hit the convoy three times with a drone as the aid workers tried to dive for cover between the vehicles and drive those wounded to safety, security sources told Haaretz.\n\nExpressing the \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the aid workers\u2019 bereaved families, the IDF insisted it was \u201creviewing the incident at the highest levels\u201d and said it would be \u201cinvestigated in the Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism: an independent, professional, and expert body\u201d.\n\n\u201cLast night, an incident took place in Gaza that resulted in the tragic death of World Central Kitchen employees as they fulfilled their vital mission of bringing food to people in need,\u201d an IDF spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cAs a professional military committed to international law, we are committed to examining our operations thoroughly and transparently. I just spoke to WCK Founder, Chef Jose Anders, and expressed the deepest condolences of the Israel Defence Forces to the families and the entire World Central Kitchen family.\n\n\u201cWe also express sincere sorrow to our allied nations who have been doing and continue to do so much to assist those in need. We will be opening a probe to examine this serious incident further. This will help us reduce the risk of such an event from occurring again.\u201d\n\nAustralian national, Zomi Frankcom, 43, was the first of the seven to be named. Former WCK chief executive Nate Mook, who first hired Ms Frankcom, described her to The Independent as a \u201cshining star\u201d and \u201cgift to the world\u201d.\n\nZomi Frankcom was described as a \u2018gift to the world\u2019 (The Independent)\n\nMs Frankcom was interviewed by this publication just three weeks before she was killed, from a Jordanian military base where she was coordinating the delivery of humanitarian aid via airdrops.\n\nPolish citizen Damian Sobol, 35, has also been named as among the dead. He started volunteering with WCK at the outset of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, to help feed refugees in the border town of Przemysl, before joining the charity\u2019s response to the earthquakes in Turkey and then in Gaza.\n\nLord David Cameron said the UK\u2019s Foreign Office was \u201cworking to verify\u201d reports that British nationals were among the aid workers killed, adding that the government wanted \u201ca full, transparent explanation of what happened\u201d.\n\nSenior Tory MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, also demanded a \u201cthorough and swift\u201d investigation.\n\nShe added: \u201cThere is also still no explanation for the bombing of the Medical Aid for Palestine complex in a safe zone, which had also been deconflicted directly with the IDF in January, which four British doctors fortunately survived.

      "article_text": "Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has taken responsibility for the strike on a Gaza aid convoy which killed three British citizens \u2013 but insisted the attack was \u201cunintended\u201d.\n\nRishi Sunak has demanded that Israel urgently investigate the strikes, which killed seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers on Monday night, including a Palestinian, an Australian, a Polish national, an American-Canadian dual citizen.\n\nThe three Britons were named by the BBC as James Henderson, John Chapman and James Kirby on Tuesday night.\n\nWith Australia, Spain and Poland also pressing for answers, and the White House warning it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the fatal attack on the convoy of aid trucks, Mr Netanyahu said: \u201cUnfortunately over the last day there was a tragic incident of an unintended strike of our forces on innocent people in the Gaza Strip.\u201d\n\nPeople inspect the site where World Central Kitchen workers were killed in Deir al-Balah (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\n\n\u201cThis happens in wartime. We are thoroughly looking into it, are in contact with the governments [of the foreigners among the dead] and will do everything to ensure it does not happen again,\u201d Mr Netanyahu said in a video message.\n\nThe convoy \u2013 consisting of two armoured cars branded with the WCK logo and a soft-skin vehicle \u2013 was hit as it was leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, where the team had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian food aid taken to Gaza on the maritime route, the aid group said.\n\nThe \u201cunforgivable\u201d attack came despite the charity coordinating on its movements with the Israeli military along approved routes, said WCK, which was founded by Spanish-American celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s. He described the aid workers as \u201cangels\u201d and said he was \u201cheartbroken and grieving for their families and friends\u201d.\n\nThe charity announced it has suspended its activities in the region.\n\nThe bodies were taken to al-Aqsa hospital, some of them wearing protective gear with the logo of World Central Kitchen charity, The Independent understands. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said the operation to recover the seven bodies took \u201cseveral hours\u201d.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the destroyed cars pictured along Al Rashid road (EPA/MOHAMMED SABER)\n\nThe Israeli military hit the convoy three times with a drone as the aid workers tried to dive for cover between the vehicles and drive those wounded to safety, security sources told Haaretz.\n\nExpressing the \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the aid workers\u2019 bereaved families, the IDF insisted it was \u201creviewing the incident at the highest levels\u201d and said it would be \u201cinvestigated in the Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism: an independent, professional, and expert body\u201d.\n\n\u201cLast night, an incident took place in Gaza that resulted in the tragic death of World Central Kitchen employees as they fulfilled their vital mission of bringing food to people in need,\u201d an IDF spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cAs a professional military committed to international law, we are committed to examining our operations thoroughly and transparently. I just spoke to WCK Founder, Chef Jose Anders, and expressed the deepest condolences of the Israel Defence Forces to the families and the entire World Central Kitchen family.\n\n\u201cWe also express sincere sorrow to our allied nations who have been doing and continue to do so much to assist those in need. We will be opening a probe to examine this serious incident further. This will help us reduce the risk of such an event from occurring again.\u201d\n\nAustralian national, Zomi Frankcom, 43, was the first of the seven to be named. Former WCK chief executive Nate Mook, who first hired Ms Frankcom, described her to The Independent as a \u201cshining star\u201d and \u201cgift to the world\u201d.\n\nZomi Frankcom was described as a \u2018gift to the world\u2019 (The Independent)\n\nMs Frankcom was interviewed by this publication just three weeks before she was killed, from a Jordanian military base where she was coordinating the delivery of humanitarian aid via airdrops.\n\nPolish citizen Damian Sobol, 35, has also been named as among the dead. He started volunteering with WCK at the outset of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, to help feed refugees in the border town of Przemysl, before joining the charity\u2019s response to the earthquakes in Turkey and then in Gaza.\n\nLord David Cameron said the UK\u2019s Foreign Office was \u201cworking to verify\u201d reports that British nationals were among the aid workers killed, adding that the government wanted \u201ca full, transparent explanation of what happened\u201d.\n\nSenior Tory MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, also demanded a \u201cthorough and swift\u201d investigation.\n\nShe added: \u201cThere is also still no explanation for the bombing of the Medical Aid for Palestine complex in a safe zone, which had also been deconflicted directly with the IDF in January, which four British doctors fortunately survived. Humanitarian agencies must be given the assurances they need that their people will be protected.\u201d\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for international law to be upheld as he described the deaths as \u201coutrageous and unacceptable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe condemn this strike,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be a full investigation and those responsible must be held to account.

      "article_text": "Germany's soccer federation is redesigning its national team's Adidas jerseys after claims that the kits' No. 44 numbering looked similar to a Nazi symbol.\n\nThe German soccer federation (DFB) announced on social media that the organization and its partner, 11teamsports, an online store that sells sports gear, will develop an alternate design for the number 4 after fans spotted similarities between the custom No. 44 jersey and the logo of the Schutzstaffel \u2013 Adolf Hitler's infamous paramilitary force.\n\nJonathan Tah of Germany, who wears No. 4, dribbles during the international friendly match between France and Germany at Groupama Stadium on March 23, 2024 in Lyon, France. Ralf Ibing - firo sportphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB said it was taking the matter \"very seriously\" after people on social media used Adidas' online customization service to make shirts with the number 44 and showed how it resembled the Schutzstaffel's SS symbol, which looks like two lightning bolts. Since no players currently on the men's nor women's soccer roster wear No. 44, the jersey needed to be created using the personalization tool.\n\n\"None of the parties involved saw any proximity to Nazi symbolism in the development process of the jersey design,\" the federation said on X. The DFB said it checks jersey numbers between zero and nine and then submits one through 26 to UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe, for review. The German soccer federation will coordinate with UEFA to make the changes.\n\nAdidas said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday that DFB and 11teamsports \"are responsible\" for the design of the names and numbers. The sports apparel company also told CBS News it's blocking the \"personalization of the jerseys in our online store.\"\n\n\"Our company stands for the promotion of diversity and inclusion, and as a company we actively oppose xenophobia, anti-Semitism, violence, and hatred in any form,\" Adidas said.\n\nGermany debuted its new Adidas jerseys during an international friendly match against France on March 23 at Groupama Stadium in Lyon, France. Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\n\nThe DFB unveiled the jerseys in March and the men's national team debuted the kits during a match against France. The jerseys will be worn by the team for the 2024 UEFA European championship, which will take place in Germany.\n\nThe controversy around the Adidas jerseys comes as Nike will become Germany's official shirt supplier, beginning in 2027. Adidas had long been part of Germany's soccer teams, having a relationship with the team for around 70 years."

The suspects fled the scene in a vehicle driven by a third male,\" London's Metropolitan Police (the Met) said in a statement.\n\nThe victim in his 30s sustained an injury to his leg in the attack in Wimbledon, southwest London, on Friday afternoon. Police said he has since been discharged from hospital.\n\nEscaping the country after the attack\n\nPolice said that after abandoning the vehicle, the suspects traveled directly to Heathrow Airport and left the United Kingdom a few hours after the attack.\n\nBritain's National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said the victim was British-based Iranian journalist Pouria Zeraati, who hosts a show on the Persian language television news network Iran International, which is critical of Iran's government. Soccer Football - FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 - Group B - England v Iran - Khalifa International Stadium, Doha, Qatar - November 21, 2022 Iran fans hold signs reading 'Freedom for Iran' and 'Woman life freedom' inside the stadium before the match. (credit: REUTERS/PAUL CHILDS)\n\nPolice said it remained unclear why the victim was attacked and officers are \"keeping an open mind as to any motivation behind this.\"\n\nThe incident was being investigated by counter-terrorism detectives because the victim was a journalist at a Persian language media organization based in Britain, and previous threats had been directed towards this group of journalists, the Met said.\n\nIn January, Britain imposed sanctions, in coordination with the United States, on Iranian officials it said were involved in threats to kill journalists on British soil, and others it said were part of international criminal gangs linked to Iran."
