      "article_text": "At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 4.35 per cent and the interest rate paid on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 4.25 per cent.\n\nInflation continues to moderate but remains high.\n\nInflation continued to ease in the December quarter. Despite this progress, inflation remains high at 4.1 per cent. Goods price inflation was lower than the RBA\u0092s November forecasts. It has continued to ease, reflecting the resolution of earlier global supply chain disruptions and a moderation in domestic demand for goods. Services price inflation, however, declined at a more gradual pace in line with the RBA\u0092s earlier forecasts and remains high. This is consistent with continuing excess demand in the economy and strong domestic cost pressures, both for labour and non-labour inputs.\n\nHigher interest rates are working to establish a more sustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply in the economy. Accordingly, conditions in the labour market continue to ease gradually, although they remain tighter than is consistent with sustained full employment and inflation at target. Wages growth has picked up but is not expected to increase much further and remains consistent with the inflation target, on the assumption that productivity growth increases to around its long-run average. Inflation is still weighing on people\u0092s real incomes and household consumption growth is weak, as is dwelling investment.\n\nThe outlook is still highly uncertain.\n\nWhile there are encouraging signs, the economic outlook is uncertain and the Board remains highly attentive to inflation risks. The central forecasts are for inflation to return to the target range of 2\u20133 per cent in 2025, and to the midpoint in 2026. Services price inflation is expected to decline gradually as demand moderates and growth in labour and non-labour costs eases. Employment is expected to continue to grow moderately and the unemployment rate and the broader underutilisation rate are expected to increase a bit further.\n\nWhile there have been favourable signs on goods price inflation abroad, services price inflation has remained persistent and the same could occur in Australia. There also remains a high level of uncertainty around the outlook for the Chinese economy and the implications of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Domestically, there are uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of monetary policy and how firms\u0092 pricing decisions and wages will respond to the slower growth in the economy at a time of excess demand, and while the labour market remains tight. The outlook for household consumption also remains uncertain.\n\nReturning inflation to target is the priority.\n\nReturning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the Board\u0092s highest priority. This is consistent with the RBA\u0092s mandate for price stability and full employment. The Board needs to be confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards the target range. To date, medium-term inflation expectations have been consistent with the inflation target and it is important that this remains the case.\n\nWhile recent data indicate that inflation is easing, it remains high. The Board expects that it will be some time yet before inflation is sustainably in the target range. The path of interest rates that will best ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe will depend upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks, and a further increase in interest rates cannot be ruled out. The Board will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board remains resolute in its determination to return inflation to target and will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome.",

The headline monthly CPI indicator was steady at 3.4 per cent over the year to January, with momentum easing over recent months, driven by moderating goods inflation. Services inflation remains elevated, and is moderating at a more gradual pace.

Accordingly, conditions in the labour market continue to ease gradually, although they remain tighter than is consistent with sustained full employment and inflation at target.

Inflation is still weighing on people\u0092s real incomes and household consumption growth is weak, as is dwelling investment.\n\nThe outlook remains highly uncertain.\n\nWhile there are encouraging signs that inflation is moderating, the economic outlook remains uncertain. The December quarter national accounts data confirmed growth has slowed. Household consumption growth remains particularly weak amid high inflation and the rise in interest rates. After recent declines, real incomes have stabilised and are expected to grow from here, which is expected to support growth in consumption later in the year.\n\nMeanwhile, growth in unit labour costs remains very high. It has begun to moderate slightly as measured productivity growth has picked up in the past two quarters but whether this trend will be sustained is uncertain.\n\nThe central forecasts are for inflation to return to the target range of 2\u20133 per cent in 2025, and to the midpoint in 2026.

      "article_title": "Statement by Philip Lowe, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision | Media Releases",

      "article_text": "At its meeting today, the Board decided to increase the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.35 per cent. It also increased the interest rate on Exchange Settlement balances by 25 basis points to 3.25 per cent.\n\nGlobal inflation remains very high. It is, however, moderating in response to lower energy prices, the resolution of supply-chain problems and the tightening of monetary policy. It will be some time, though, before inflation is back to target rates. The outlook for the global economy remains subdued, with below average growth expected this year and next.\n\nIn Australia, CPI inflation over the year to the December quarter was 7.8 per cent, the highest since 1990. In underlying terms, inflation was 6.9 per cent, which was higher than expected. Global factors explain much of this high inflation, but strong domestic demand is adding to the inflationary pressures in a number of areas of the economy.\n\nInflation is expected to decline this year due to both global factors and slower growth in domestic demand. The central forecast is for CPI inflation to decline to 4\u00be per cent this year and to around 3 per cent by mid-2025. Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case.\n\nThe Australian economy grew strongly over 2022. The central forecast is little changed from three months ago, with GDP growth expected to slow to around 1\u00bd per cent over 2023 and 2024. The recovery in spending on services following the lifting of COVID restrictions has largely run its course and the tighter financial conditions will constrain spending more broadly.\n\nThe labour market remains very tight. The unemployment rate has been steady at around 3\u00bd per cent over recent months, the lowest rate since 1974. Job vacancies and job ads are both at very high levels, but have declined a little recently. Many firms continue to experience difficulty hiring workers, although some report a recent easing in labour shortages. As economic growth slows, unemployment is expected to increase. The central forecast is for the unemployment rate to increase to 3\u00be per cent by the end of this year and 4\u00bd per cent by mid-2025.\n\nWages growth is continuing to pick up from the low rates of recent years and a further pick-up is expected due to the tight labour market and higher inflation. Given the importance of avoiding a prices-wages spiral, the Board will continue to pay close attention to both the evolution of labour costs and the price-setting behaviour of firms in the period ahead.\n\nThe Board recognises that monetary policy operates with a lag and that the full effect of the cumulative increase in interest rates is yet to be felt in mortgage payments. There is uncertainty around the timing and extent of the expected slowdown in household spending. Some households have substantial savings buffers, but others are experiencing a painful squeeze on their budgets due to higher interest rates and the increase in the cost of living. Household balance sheets are also being affected by the decline in housing prices. Another source of uncertainty is how the global economy responds to the large and rapid increase in interest rates around the world. These uncertainties mean that there are a range of potential scenarios for the Australian economy.\n\nThe Board\u0092s priority is to return inflation to target. High inflation makes life difficult for people and damages the functioning of the economy. And if high inflation were to become entrenched in people\u0092s expectations, it would be very costly to reduce later. The Board is seeking to return inflation to the 2\u20133 per cent range while keeping the economy on an even keel, but the path to achieving a soft landing remains a narrow one.\n\nThe Board expects that further increases in interest rates will be needed over the months ahead to ensure that inflation returns to target and that this period of high inflation is only temporary. In assessing how much further interest rates need to increase, the Board will be paying close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board remains resolute in its determination to return inflation to target and will do what is necessary to achieve that.",

      "article_text": "At its meeting today, the Board decided to increase the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.60 per cent. It also increased the interest rate on Exchange Settlement balances by 25 basis points to 3.50 per cent.\n\nGlobal inflation remains very high. In headline terms it is moderating, although services price inflation remains elevated in many economies. It will be some time before inflation is back to target rates. The outlook for the global economy remains subdued, with below average growth expected this year and next.\n\nThe monthly CPI indicator suggests that inflation has peaked in Australia. Goods price inflation is expected to moderate over the months ahead due to both global developments and softer demand in Australia. Services price inflation remains high, with strong demand for some services over the summer. Rents are increasing at the fastest rate in some years, with vacancy rates low in many parts of the country. The central forecast is for inflation to decline this year and next, to be around 3 per cent in mid-2025. Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case.\n\nGrowth in the Australian economy has slowed, with GDP increasing by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter and 2.7 per cent over the year. Growth over the next couple of years is expected to be below trend. Household consumption growth has slowed due to the tighter financial conditions and the outlook for housing construction has softened. In contrast, the outlook for business investment remains positive, with many businesses operating at a very high level of capacity utilisation.\n\nThe labour market remains very tight, although conditions have eased a little. The unemployment rate remains at close to a 50-year low. Employment fell in January, but this partly reflects changing seasonal patterns in labour hiring. Many firms continue to experience difficulty hiring workers, although some report a recent easing in labour shortages. As economic growth slows, unemployment is expected to increase.\n\nWages growth is continuing to pick up in response to the tight labour market and higher inflation. At the aggregate level, wages growth is still consistent with the inflation target and recent data suggest a lower risk of a cycle in which prices and wages chase one another. The Board, however, remains alert to the risk of a prices-wages spiral, given the limited spare capacity in the economy and the historically low rate of unemployment. Accordingly, it will continue to pay close attention to both the evolution of labour costs and the price-setting behaviour of firms.\n\nThe Board recognises that monetary policy operates with a lag and that the full effect of the cumulative increase in interest rates is yet to be felt in mortgage payments. There is uncertainty around the timing and extent of the slowdown in household spending.

      "article_text": "At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 3.60 per cent and the interest rate on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 3.50 per cent.\n\nThis decision follows a cumulative increase in interest rates of 3\u00bd percentage points since May last year. The Board recognises that monetary policy operates with a lag and that the full effect of this substantial increase in interest rates is yet to be felt. The Board took the decision to hold interest rates steady this month to provide additional time to assess the impact of the increase in interest rates to date and the economic outlook.\n\nGlobal inflation remains very high. In headline terms it is moderating, although services price inflation remains high in many economies. The outlook for the global economy remains subdued, with below-average growth expected this year and next. The recent banking system problems in the United States and Switzerland have resulted in volatility in financial markets and a reassessment of the outlook for global interest rates. These problems are also expected to lead to tighter financial conditions, which would be an additional headwind for the global economy.\n\nThe Australian banking system is strong, well capitalised and highly liquid. It is well placed to provide the credit that the economy needs.\n\nA range of information, including the monthly CPI indicator, suggests that inflation has peaked in Australia. Goods price inflation is expected to moderate over the months ahead due to global developments and softer demand in Australia. Meanwhile, rents are increasing at the fastest rate in some years, with vacancy rates low in many parts of the country. The prices of utilities are also rising quickly. The central forecast is for inflation to decline this year and next, to around 3 per cent in mid-2025. Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case.\n\nGrowth in the Australian economy has slowed, with growth over the next couple of years expected to be below trend. There is further evidence that the combination of higher interest rates, cost-of-living pressures and a decline in housing prices is leading to a substantial slowing in household spending. While some households have substantial savings buffers, others are experiencing a painful squeeze on their finances.\n\nThe labour market remains very tight. The unemployment rate is at a near 50-year low and underemployment is also low. Many firms continue to experience difficulty hiring workers, although some report an easing in labour shortages and the number of vacancies has declined a little. As economic growth slows, unemployment is expected to increase.\n\nWages growth is continuing to increase in response to the tight labour market and higher inflation. At the aggregate level, wages growth is still consistent with the inflation target, provided that productivity growth picks up. The Board remains alert to the risk of a prices-wages spiral, given the limited spare capacity in the economy and the historically low rate of unemployment. Accordingly, it will continue to pay close attention to both the evolution of labour costs and the price-setting behaviour of firms.\n\nThe Board\u0092s priority is to return inflation to target. High inflation makes life difficult for people and damages the functioning of the economy. And if high inflation were to become entrenched in people\u0092s expectations, it would be very costly to reduce later, involving even higher interest rates and a larger rise in unemployment. The Board is seeking to return inflation to the 2\u20133 per cent target range while keeping the economy on an even keel, but the path to achieving a soft landing remains a narrow one.\n\nThe Board expects that some further tightening of monetary policy may well be needed to ensure that inflation returns to target. The decision to hold interest rates steady this month provides the Board with more time to assess the state of the economy and the outlook, in an environment of considerable uncertainty. In assessing when and how much further interest rates need to increase, the Board will be paying close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.

      "article_title": "Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia | Media Releases",

      "article_text": "The Bank welcomes today\u0092s release of the Review of the Reserve Bank and the government\u0092s response. The Review is comprehensive and covers the Bank\u0092s objectives and responsibilities, the framework for monetary policy, the governance of the Bank and the way the Reserve Bank Board and the Bank operate. The Bank thanks the Review Panel and Secretariat for their work and all those who provided submissions.\n\nGovernor Philip Lowe welcomed the Review Panel\u0092s support for the current monetary policy framework in Australia, including the flexible inflation target and the operational independence of the Bank. He also welcomed the support for the Council of Financial Regulators and the explicit recognition of the Bank\u0092s responsibility for financial stability.\n\nThe Review recommends the establishment of separate boards for monetary policy and governance of the Bank. This change can help strengthen both the operation of monetary policy and the way the Bank is governed. It will require changes to the Reserve Bank Act 1959 , which is a matter for the Australian Government and Parliament. The Bank will work constructively to ensure that this and the other recommended changes to the Reserve Bank Act strengthen the Bank and the way it operates. It will also work constructively with the Treasurer on an updated Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy .\n\nThe Review makes a number of recommendations regarding how the Board works, including the frequency of meetings and the Bank\u0092s approach to communication. The Board will consider these issues over coming meetings and develop and implement a new set of arrangements.\n\nThe Review also makes recommendations that go to the way the Bank operates. These include appointing a Chief Operating Officer, elevating the communication function, enhancing the processes supporting the Board and monetary policy strategy, and continuing to invest in the diversity and skills of our leadership team. The Bank will develop a plan to implement these changes in the most effective way.\n\nThe Governor said: \u0091The Review Panel rightly acknowledged the substantial contribution the Bank has made to Australia\u0092s economic success and the skills and dedication of the staff. It also acknowledged the RBA is highly regarded and respected in Australia and overseas. The recommended changes will build on that strong foundation and strengthen the Bank\u0092s governance and decision-making processes. They will help us deal with the complex world in which we operate as we strive to promote the economic welfare of the Australian people.\u0092\n\nA media conference will be held at 12pm AEST. Contact RBAInfo@rba.gov.au for details. The conference will also be broadcast live.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Reserve Bank is responsible for monetary policy in Australia, the determination of payments system policy, maintaining a stable financial system, issuing the nation\u0092s banknotes, operating the core of the payments system and providing banking services to government.\n\nThe Review of the RBA was announced by the Treasurer, the Hon Dr Jim Chalmers MP, in July 2022. The Reserve Bank assisted the Review Panel in several ways, including through the provision of staff for the Review Secretariat, individual and group discussions, the provision of information in response to questions along with a large number of related documents. Staff were also invited to make public or private submissions, respond to a confidential survey and participate in focus groups. The Review was handed to the government on 31 March, and it was issued along with the government\u0092s response by the Treasurer on 20 April.",

      "article_text": "At its meeting today, the Board decided to increase the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.85 per cent. It also increased the rate paid on Exchange Settlement balances by 25 basis points to 3.75 per cent.\n\nInflation in Australia has passed its peak, but at 7 per cent is still too high and it will be some time yet before it is back in the target range. Given the importance of returning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe, the Board judged that a further increase in interest rates was warranted today.\n\nThe Board held interest rates steady last month to provide additional time to assess the state of the economy and the outlook. While the recent data showed a welcome decline in inflation, the central forecast remains that it takes a couple of years before inflation returns to the top of the target range; inflation is expected to be 4\u00bd per cent in 2023 and 3 per cent in mid-2025. Goods price inflation is clearly slowing due to a better balance of supply and demand following the resolution of the pandemic disruptions. But services price inflation is still very high and broadly based and the experience overseas points to upside risks. Unit labour costs are also rising briskly, with productivity growth remaining subdued.\n\nThe recent Australian data also confirmed that the labour market remains very tight, with the unemployment rate at a near 50-year low. Many firms continue to experience difficulty hiring workers, although there has been some easing in labour shortages and the number of vacancies has declined a little.\n\nThe Board\u0092s priority remains to return inflation to target. High inflation makes life difficult for people and damages the functioning of the economy.

Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case. Today\u0092s further adjustment in interest rates will help in this regard.\n\nWages growth has picked up in response to the tight labour market and high inflation. At the aggregate level, wages growth is still consistent with the inflation target, provided that productivity growth picks up. The Board remains alert to the risk that expectations of ongoing high inflation contribute to larger increases in both prices and wages, especially given the limited spare capacity in the economy and the historically low rate of unemployment. Accordingly, it will continue to pay close attention to both the evolution of labour costs and the price-setting behaviour of firms.\n\nThe Board is still seeking to keep the economy on an even keel as inflation returns to the 2\u20133 per cent target range, but the path to achieving a soft landing remains a narrow one. The central forecast is for the economy to continue growing, albeit at a below-trend pace; GDP is forecast to increase by 1\u00bc per cent this year and around 2 per cent over the year to mid-2025. Given the expected below-trend growth in the economy, the unemployment rate is forecast to increase gradually to be around 4\u00bd per cent in mid-2025.\n\nA significant source of uncertainty continues to be the outlook for household consumption. The combination of higher interest rates, cost-of-living pressures and the earlier decline in housing prices is leading to a substantial slowing in household spending. While some households have substantial savings buffers, others are experiencing a painful squeeze on their finances. There are also uncertainties regarding the global economy, which is expected to grow at a below-average rate over the next couple of years.\n\nSome further tightening of monetary policy may be required to ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe, but that will depend upon how the economy and inflation evolve. The Board will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board remains resolute in its determination to return inflation to target and will do what is necessary to achieve that.",

      "article_text": "In January 2023, the Reserve Bank of Australia commissioned a comprehensive review of the operating environment supporting the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS). This system is a critical part of Australia\u0092s payments infrastructure and is owned and operated by the Reserve Bank. The review, conducted by Deloitte, was requested by the Payments System Board (PSB) following a major outage of the system on 12 October 2022. The review was discussed at the PSB meeting on 25 May where the PSB also considered an internal assessment of RITS against the relevant international Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures prepared by the Bank\u0092s Payments Policy Department.\n\nTo support transparency, the Bank is today releasing the Deloitte review and the assessment against the international principles, and the Bank\u0092s initial response, as outlined below.\n\nThe Bank is committed to the highest standards in operating critically important national payments infrastructure. The review and assessment highlight that there is work to be done here. The Deloitte review concluded that the Bank has relied heavily on experienced and dedicated staff and has a strong culture of care. It also concluded that the Bank needs to strengthen its systems and processes if it is to achieve the high standards of service availability that are required.\n\nThe Bank is committed to implementing the recommendations in the review and assessment. Specifically, it plans to:\n\nformalise the RITS operating model to ensure responsibilities are well articulated, investments are appropriately targeted, and resilience is enhanced.\n\nstrengthen the risk management framework, with a focus on improving accountability for assurance activities.\n\nuplift processes supporting the RITS ecosystem including better use of automation and more effective change management practices.\n\nfurther develop frameworks to encourage feedback and constructive challenge in the areas supporting RITS, consistent with broader Bank initiatives.\n\nA detailed implementation plan is now being developed, with some elements of that plan overlapping the Bank\u0092s response to the recommendations arising from the Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nThe Bank will report to the PSB on progress in implementing the improvements at future Board meetings.\n\nBackground and related information\n\nThe Bank owns and operates RITS, Australia\u0092s real-time gross settlement system. RITS is critical national infrastructure for the Australian payments system and is required to function as a highly available and resilient system.

      "article_title": "Statement by Philip Lowe, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision | Media Releases",

      "article_text": "At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 4.10 per cent and the interest rate paid on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 4.00 per cent.\n\nInterest rates have been increased by 4 percentage points since May last year. The higher interest rates are working to establish a more sustainable balance between supply and demand in the economy and will continue to do so. In light of this and the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, the Board again decided to hold interest rates steady this month. This will provide further time to assess the impact of the increase in interest rates to date and the economic outlook.\n\nInflation in Australia is declining but is still too high at 6 per cent. Goods price inflation has eased, but the prices of many services are rising briskly. Rent inflation is also elevated. The central forecast is for CPI inflation to continue to decline, to be around 3\u00bc per cent by the end of 2024 and to be back within the 2\u20133 per cent target range in late 2025.\n\nThe Australian economy is experiencing a period of below-trend growth and this is expected to continue for a while. Household consumption growth is weak, as is dwelling investment. The central forecast is for GDP growth of around 1\u00be per cent over 2024 and a little above 2 per cent over the following year.\n\nConditions in the labour market remain very tight, although they have eased a little. Job vacancies and advertisements are still at very high levels, although firms report that labour shortages have lessened. With the economy and employment forecast to grow below trend, the unemployment rate is expected to rise gradually from its current rate of 3\u00bd per cent to around 4\u00bd per cent late next year. Wages growth has picked up in response to the tight labour market and high inflation. At the aggregate level, wages growth is still consistent with the inflation target, provided that productivity growth picks up.\n\nReturning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the Board\u0092s priority. High inflation makes life difficult for everyone and damages the functioning of the economy. It erodes the value of savings, hurts household budgets, makes it harder for businesses to plan and invest, and worsens income inequality. And if high inflation were to become entrenched in people\u0092s expectations, it would be very costly to reduce later, involving even higher interest rates and a larger rise in unemployment. To date, medium-term inflation expectations have been consistent with the inflation target and it is important that this remains the case.\n\nThe recent data are consistent with inflation returning to the 2\u20133 per cent target range over the forecast horizon and with output and employment continuing to grow. There are though significant uncertainties. Services price inflation has been surprisingly persistent overseas and the same could occur in Australia. There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the operation of monetary policy and how firms\u0092 pricing decisions and wages will respond to the slowing in the economy at a time when the labour market remains tight. The outlook for household consumption is also an ongoing source of uncertainty. Many households are experiencing a painful squeeze on their finances, while some are benefiting from rising housing prices, substantial savings buffers and higher interest income. In aggregate, consumption growth has slowed substantially due to the combination of cost-of-living pressures and higher interest rates.\n\nSome further tightening of monetary policy may be required to ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe, but that will depend upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks. In making its decisions, the Board will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board remains resolute in its determination to return inflation to target and will do what is necessary to achieve that.",

      "article_text": "The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) today released a report on the findings from a joint research project involving industry that explored potential use cases for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in Australia.\n\nThe project involved the RBA issuing a limited-scale \u0091pilot\u0092 CBDC that was a real legal claim on the RBA. The pilot CBDC was used by selected industry participants to demonstrate how a CBDC could be used to provide innovative payment and settlement services to Australian households and businesses. The various use cases explored in the project highlighted a range of areas where a CBDC could enhance the functioning of the payments system. At the same time, the project raised a number of legal, regulatory, technical and operational issues associated with a CBDC that warrant further consideration in future research.\n\nBrad Jones, Assistant Governor (Financial System) at the RBA said, \u2018The project yielded valuable insights into how a CBDC, alongside other innovations in digital money, could potentially unlock benefits for the Australian financial system and the wider economy. It also highlighted the benefits of close engagement between industry and policymakers in exploring the opportunities and challenges associated with innovations in digital money. The key findings from the project will help to shape the next phase of the RBA\u0092s research program into the future of money in Australia. Alongside our ongoing work on cross border payments, this will include deepening our understanding of the role that tokenised asset markets and programmable payments could have in the Australian economy.\u2019\n\nDr Andreas Furche, CEO of the DFCRC, said, \u2018The report underscores that innovation in finance is a continuous journey. The strong industry engagement in this project speaks to the importance of collaboration between central banks as ultimate issuers of national currency, and industry experts driving its potential use cases. As we move forward, our research on CBDC could look to target use cases where CBDC has the best potential to provide an infrastructure layer for further innovation in financial products and services.\u2019\n\nThe RBA and DFCRC would like to extend their appreciation to the many industry participants who invested considerable time and effort in the project.\n\nFor more information about the project see: Australian CBDC Pilot Project.",

Concerns raised included the adequacy of ASX\u0092s stakeholder engagement and governance process and ASX\u0092s management of intragroup conflicts of interest.\n\nThe letter requires ASX Clear and ASX Settlement to resource, consult and engage with the Advisory Group in good faith and in the public interest.\n\nASIC Chairman Joe Longo said, \u0091The Advisory Group\u0092s role in assisting ASX Clear and ASX Settlement on the CHESS replacement program is vital to this process. Genuine collaboration between ASX, the Advisory Group and industry will be necessary to achieve the best outcome for the market, for listed companies and investors.\n\n\u0091As the operator of critical national infrastructure, ASX must be held to the highest standards.

This includes measures under the current regulatory framework and any new powers ASIC receives under the Government\u0092s proposed Competition in Clearing and Settlement Reforms and Financial Market Infrastructure Regulatory Reforms.\u0092\n\nRBA Deputy Governor Michele Bullock said, \u0091It is important that the market\u0092s trust and confidence in the CHESS replacement program is restored. To do this, the program requires a fresh and collaborative approach that draws on the advice and perspectives of a range of experienced professionals. It is important that ASX and the Advisory Group work collaboratively to a solution that is in the public interest.\u0092\n\nThe Regulators will actively monitor ASX Clear and ASX Settlement\u0092s engagement with the Advisory Group.\n\nASX Clear and ASX Settlement are expected to formally acknowledge the Regulators\u0092 joint letter and provide a public undertaking that it will comply with these expectations by 31 August 2023.\n\nBackground\n\nASIC and the RBA are co-regulators of licensed clearing and settlement (CS) facilities.\n\nThe RBA and ASIC have supervisory responsibilities for the four CS facilities in the ASX Group: two central counterparties \u2013 ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Ltd \u2013 and two securities settlement facilities \u2013 ASX Settlement Pty Ltd and Austraclear Limited.\n\nThe RBA conducts annual assessments covering the CS facilities\u0092 observance of relevant Financial Stability Standards determined by the RBA. ASIC has separate, but complementary, responsibilities for the licensing and supervision of CS facilities licensed under Part 7.3 of the Act.

      "article_text": "The Bank has released a Conclusions Paper setting out the conclusions of its recent public consultation on options for further enhancing the competitiveness, efficiency and safety of Australia\u0092s debit card market. As noted in the Payments System Board\u0092s post-meeting media release in August, the key conclusions are:\n\nThe Board decided that it will not continue to explore prohibiting the setting of a default routing network on dual-network debit cards (DNDCs). Stakeholders\u0092 feedback indicated that any benefits from such a prohibition would likely be outweighed by the costs and risks involved. In particular, prohibiting the setting of a priority network would raise the risk of failed transactions and would be costly as all DNDCs would need to be re-issued.\n\nStakeholders\u0092 feedback indicated that any benefits from such a prohibition would likely be outweighed by the costs and risks involved. In particular, prohibiting the setting of a priority network would raise the risk of failed transactions and would be costly as all DNDCs would need to be re-issued. The Board, however, remains strongly supportive of merchants having the ability to choose their preferred debit card network through least-cost routing (LCR). The Board expects providers to make faster progress on enabling LCR for merchants that could benefit from it. If providers do not make substantial progress in enabling LCR for more merchants by June 2024, the Bank will explore imposing a formal regulatory requirement on providers to enable LCR for their merchants. Going forward, the Board also expects the industry to implement new form factors in a way that is compatible with LCR from the outset.\n\nIf providers do not make substantial progress in enabling LCR for more merchants by June 2024, the Bank will explore imposing a formal regulatory requirement on providers to enable LCR for their merchants. Going forward, the Board also expects the industry to implement new form factors in a way that is compatible with LCR from the outset. The Board decided that following further consultation with industry, the Bank will endeavour to publish high-level expectations on the tokenisation of payment cards by the end of 2023. These expectations will be aimed at helping to improve security, efficiency and competition for online card payments. The Bank has asked Australian Payments Network (AusPayNet) to coordinate the industry\u0092s work to meet the Bank\u0092s expectations and to draft more specific tokenisation standards if required.",

      "article_text": "The Reserve Bank of Australia today released the 2023 Assessment of the ASX Clearing and Settlement Facilities. This assesses the performance of the ASX CS Facilities against the Bank\u0092s Financial Stability Standards (FSS). The ASX CS facilities were rated as having \u201cobserved\u201d or \u201cbroadly observed\u201d most of the FSS. The Bank recognises there has been improved engagement and an increased commitment to transparency from the ASX. The Bank welcomes this development and considers it important that it continues.\n\nHowever the Bank assessed that the CS facilities \u201cpartly observed\u201d requirements under the FSS related to Governance, the Framework for the Comprehensive Management of Risks, and Operational Risk. The Bank has issued a number of recommendations in response, including that ASX should:\n\nredouble its efforts to ensure that key issues are raised with the ASX boards\n\nimplement changes required to remediate the relationship between Internal Audit and the executive, while ensuring that Internal Audit remains an independent source of challenge\n\nfacilitate effective stakeholder engagement, including by actively consulting stakeholders on the solution redesign, project, and implementation timeline for the CHESS replacement\n\nprioritise the implementation of short-term controls to mitigate the immediate risks of ageing assets. Related, ASX should promptly devise and implement a comprehensive roadmap to remediate its currently identified ageing assets, and develop and implement a robust long-term strategy to ensure that technology assets are proactively managed and renewed well before they approach obsolescence.\n\nThe Bank\u0092s assessment includes a detailed review of the current CHESS for cash equities. While the review found that the current CHESS is broadly consistent with the FSS, high priority should be placed on the management of ageing assets supporting the current CHESS, capacity requirements and bottlenecks, management of resources and risk management.\n\nThe Bank also conducted a detailed review of ASX\u0092s management of Credit Risk, with several findings identified relating to the adequacy of ASX\u0092s stress testing framework.\n\nRBA Assistant Governor (Financial System) Brad Jones said, \u0091The Bank welcomes the progress that has been initiated under the new ASX leadership, including increased engagement with regulators and stronger accountability for executives. However, it is important that ASX address recommendations related to board oversight, the effectiveness of the internal audit function, stakeholder management and the management of ageing assets. Given ASX operates critical financial market infrastructure, it is imperative that it continues to conduct its clearing and settlement operations in a way that promotes stability in the Australian financial system.\u0092\n\nBackground\n\nThe Reserve Bank is responsible for the supervision of Australian-licensed CS facilities with a focus on financial stability and the reduction of systemic risk. Systemically important CS facilities are assessed on a regular basis against the Financial Stability Standards (FSS) determined by the Bank.\n\nThe Bank conducts annual assessments of ASX\u0092s four CS facilities: two central counterparties \u2013 ASX Clear Pty Limited and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Limited \u2013 and two securities settlement facilities \u2013 ASX Settlement Pty Limited and Austraclear Limited.

      "article_text": "The Reserve Bank welcomes the publication today of harmonised ISO 20022 data requirements for cross-border payments by the Bank for International Settlements\u0092 Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (\u201cCPMI ISO 20022 data requirements\u201d).\n\nThe Reserve Bank believes that global adoption of the CPMI ISO 20022 data requirements will help to reduce inefficiencies in the processing of cross-border payments that can arise from varying implementations of the ISO 20022 messaging standard, misaligned message flows and inconsistent data usage. The ISO 20022 messaging standard \u2013 a global and open messaging standard for exchanging financial information - is being increasingly adopted by payment systems around the world. Widespread implementation of the CPMI ISO 20022 data requirements is expected to lead to increased straight-through-processing of cross-border payments, helping to make them cheaper, faster and more transparent for end users.\n\nThe Reserve Bank, AusPayNet and Australian Payments Plus intend to align their relevant ISO 20022 message usage guidelines with the CPMI ISO 20022 data requirements for cross-border payments prior to the CPMI\u0092s end-2027 timeline for global adoption.\n\nThe Reserve Bank chairs the CPMI working group that developed the CPMI ISO 20022 data requirements for end-to-end use in cross-border payment transactions. The Reserve Bank will now work with the CPMI to encourage international market infrastructures and payment service providers participating in cross-border payments to align their ISO 20022 message usage guidelines with the CPMI ISO 20022 data requirements. This work is one example of Australia\u0092s contribution to the G20 programme to enhance cross-border payments.\n\n\u201cThe publication of the CPMI ISO 20022 data requirements is a positive and practical step in the G20 programme to enhance cross-border payments. The implementation of these requirements will require a co-ordinated effort by the global payments community over the next few years,\u201d said Michele Bullock, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and former Co-Chair of the CPMI Messaging Workstream.\n\nBackground information\n\nA priority action in the G20 roadmap to enhance cross-border payments is to transition to richer, internationally harmonised message formats for payments, based on the ISO 20022 messaging standard, which should help to lower costs and speed up payments over time. The CPMI ISO 20022 data requirements will help to align the implementation and use of ISO 20022 globally to deliver its full benefit.\n\nCross-border Payments - Financial Stability Board (fsb.org)\n\nG20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments: Priority actions for achieving the G20 targets - Financial Stability Board (fsb.org)\n\nIn Australia, AusPayNet manages the high-value clearing system (HVCS) and Australian Payments Plus operates the New Payments Platform (NPP).

      "article_title": "Statement by Michele Bullock, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision | Media Releases",

      "article_text": "At its meeting today, the Board decided to raise the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 4.35 per cent. It also increased the interest rate paid on Exchange Settlement balances by 25 basis points to 4.25 per cent.\n\nInflation in Australia has passed its peak but is still too high and is proving more persistent than expected a few months ago. The latest reading on CPI inflation indicates that while goods price inflation has eased further, the prices of many services are continuing to rise briskly. While the central forecast is for CPI inflation to continue to decline, progress looks to be slower than earlier expected. CPI inflation is now expected to be around 3\u00bd per cent by the end of 2024 and at the top of the target range of 2 to 3 per cent by the end of 2025. The Board judged an increase in interest rates was warranted today to be more assured that inflation would return to target in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nThe Board had held interest rates steady since June following an increase of 4 percentage points since May last year. It had judged that higher interest rates were working to establish a more sustainable balance between supply and demand in the economy. Furthermore, it had noted that the impact of the more recent rate rises would continue to flow through the economy. It had therefore decided that it was appropriate to hold rates steady to provide time to assess the impact of the increase in interest rates so far. In particular, the Board had indicated that it would be paying close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.\n\nSince its August meeting, the Board has received updated information on inflation, the labour market, economic activity and the revised set of forecasts. The weight of this information suggests that the risk of inflation remaining higher for longer has increased. While the economy is experiencing a period of below-trend growth, it has been stronger than expected over the first half of the year. Underlying inflation was higher than expected at the time of the August forecasts, including across a broad range of services. Conditions in the labour market have eased but they remain tight. Housing prices are continuing to rise across the country.\n\nAt the same time, high inflation is weighing on people\u0092s real incomes and household consumption growth is weak, as is dwelling investment. Given that the economy is forecast to grow below trend, employment is expected to grow slower than the labour force and the unemployment rate is expected to rise gradually to around 4\u00bc per cent. This is a more moderate increase than previously forecast. Wages growth has picked up over the past year but is still consistent with the inflation target, provided that productivity growth picks up.\n\nReturning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the Board\u0092s priority. High inflation makes life difficult for everyone and damages the functioning of the economy. It erodes the value of savings, hurts household budgets, makes it harder for businesses to plan and invest, and worsens income inequality. And if high inflation were to become entrenched in people\u0092s expectations, it would be much more costly to reduce later, involving even higher interest rates and a larger rise in unemployment. To date, medium-term inflation expectations have been consistent with the inflation target and it is important that this remains the case.\n\nThere are still significant uncertainties around the outlook. Services price inflation has been surprisingly persistent overseas and the same could occur in Australia. There are uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of monetary policy and how firms\u0092 pricing decisions and wages will respond to the slower growth in the economy at a time when the labour market remains tight. The outlook for household consumption also remains uncertain, with many households experiencing a painful squeeze on their finances, while some are benefiting from rising housing prices, substantial savings buffers and higher interest income. And globally, there remains a high level of uncertainty around the outlook for the Chinese economy and the implications of the conflicts abroad.\n\nWhether further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe will depend upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks. In making its decisions, the Board will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board remains resolute in its determination to return inflation to target and will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome.",

      "article_text": "Today, ASIC and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) (the Regulators) acknowledged ASX\u0092s announcement of a solution design to replace CHESS.\n\nThe product-based solution and vendor announced by ASX is a foundational step in getting the CHESS replacement program back on track.\n\nThis follows advice provided by the ASX Cash Equities Clearing and Settlement Advisory Group (Advisory Group), a small group of recognised industry leaders established to advise ASX Clear and ASX Settlement on strategic clearing and settlement issues led by independent chair Alan Cameron AO.\n\nASIC Chair Joe Longo said, `This is an important decision by ASX, but there is still a long way to go to deliver a CHESS replacement. It will be critical for ASX to now focus on engaging with the market on the detailed design of the CHESS Replacement program with a realistic and achievable timeline for implementation.\u0092\n\nThe Advisory Group considered that a product-based solution, presented by ASX, and assessed by it, is an appropriate option to support a safe and timely replacement of CHESS. In addition, the Advisory Group responded with recommendations to ASX to provide clear statements on the industry impact, including the benefits to the market of the selected solution and ASX\u0092s commitment to building a system that is interoperable. The Advisory Group also noted the importance of the competition in clearing and settlement legislation, and supporting ASIC rules to provide regulatory backing for interoperability.\n\n\u0091I would like to thank Alan Cameron and the members of the Advisory Group for their work and advice. I look forward to the Advisory Group\u0092s ongoing role in providing input throughout the CHESS replacement program, and on other strategic clearing and settlement issues,\u0092 Mr Longo added.\n\nRBA Governor Michele Bullock said, \u0091Today\u0092s announcement sets a new direction for the CHESS Replacement program. The Advisory Group, under Independent Chair Alan Cameron, has played an important role in bringing the interests of the market as a whole into today\u0092s decision.\n\n\u0091The Advisory Group\u0092s input will remain critical throughout the implementation phase of the replacement solution. It will also be critical for ASX to address the findings from various external audits and reviews so that past issues with the program are not repeated.\u0092\n\nIn the coming weeks, the Regulators expect ASX to publish its special report covering the ASX Licensees\u0092 current portfolio, program and project management frameworks, and an assessment of those frameworks against internationally recognised standards. In addition, ASX will publish the external audit of this report undertaken by Ernst & Young.\n\nASX will also need to ensure existing CHESS continues to be maintained to meet ongoing resilience, reliability, integrity, and security requirements. This will be a continued focus for ASIC and the RBA.\n\nThe replacement of CHESS is a complex and technical program of work. It is critically important that robust and transparent governance arrangements are put in place by ASX to manage the risks associated with such an implementation.\n\nBackground\n\nASIC and the RBA are co-regulators of licensed clearing and settlement (CS) facilities.\n\nThe RBA and ASIC have separate but complementary supervisory responsibilities for the four CS facilities in the ASX Group: two central counterparties \u2013 ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Ltd \u2013 and two securities settlement facilities \u2013 ASX Settlement Pty Ltd and Austraclear Limited.\n\nThe RBA has determined standards for the purposes of ensuring that CS facility licensees conduct their affairs in a way that promotes the overall stability of the Australian financial system. The RBA conducts annual assessments of how well the ASX CS facilities are complying with their statutory obligations to comply with those standards and to do all other things necessary to reduce systemic risk.\n\nASIC has separate, but complementary, responsibilities for the licensing and supervision of CS facilities licensed under Part 7.3 of the Act. ASIC is responsible for assessing whether a CS facility\u0092s services are provided in a fair and effective way. ASIC also has regulatory responsibilities for operators of licensed markets, including the ASX market. In carrying out supervision and assessments of CS facilities, the RBA and ASIC work closely as appropriate.\n\n",

      "article_text": "The Bank has released a final set of expectations for the Tokenisation of Payment Cards and Storage of Primary Account Numbers (PANs), aimed at improving security, efficiency and competition for online card payments. The key expectations the Bank has set are:\n\nAll relevant industry participants should support token portability and token synchronisation by the end of June 2025. To link multiple tokens and aid token synchronicity, a unique account identifier, such as the Payment Account Reference (PAR), should be widely shared and used throughout the Australian payments ecosystem.\n\nTo link multiple tokens and aid token synchronicity, a unique account identifier, such as the Payment Account Reference (PAR), should be widely shared and used throughout the Australian payments ecosystem.

However, the paper also noted that merchants and payment service providers continue to retain sensitive card details, sometimes with minimal security, which undermines the security benefits of tokenisation. Stakeholders had also argued that there were some areas where standardisation may be necessary to ensure that the full benefits of tokenisation are realised without impeding competition. Accordingly, following a round of consultation with industry stakeholders, the Bank published a set of draft expectations in a Conclusions Paper in September 2023, aimed at addressing these issues. The Bank subsequently received feedback on these draft expectations, as well as the appropriate scope of cards to be covered by the expectations.",

      "article_text": "\u201eFaced with a difficult environment for monetary policymaking, the Eurosystem \u2013 and the OeNB as a its member \u2013 stayed the course in 2023. In view of elevated inflation, we continued to exit from accommodative policies and gradually raised key interest rates. In 2023, geopolitical conflicts and wars resulted in big political and economic challenges. In 2024, on top of the ongoing armed conflicts, elections are coming up in a number of major economies. Other challenges that persist for the economy, politics and, in fact, society at large, are the digital tech transformation, climate change, energy transition and demographic change,\u201d Robert Holzmann, Governor of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB), said today during the presentation of the OeNB\u2019s 2023 financial statements and Annual Report.\n\nTo dampen high inflation in the euro area, the Governing Council of the ECB has been gradually raising key interest rates since 2022. The interest rate hikes made in 2023 continued to affect the profitability of the Eurosystem central banks, including the OeNB.\n\nThe OeNB\u2019s negative operating result for 2023 reflects an asset liability mismatch. In other words, the interest expense the OeNB paid for commercial banks\u2019 deposits exceeded the interest income it received from the fixed but currently significantly lower yields on the securities it had purchased under the asset purchase programs. Commercial banks\u2019 deposits are recorded on the liability side of the OeNB's balance sheet, the securities on the asset side.\n\n\u201eWhether central banks generate a profit or loss comes second to the mandate on which we have to deliver. Maintaining price stability over the medium term is the objective that the Eurosystem and the Governing Council of the ECB pursue with their policy decisions,\u201c Governor Holzmann explained.\u201c On occasion, this may mean that central banks end up disclosing unfavorable results for some periods, like the negative operating result the OeNB arrived at in 2023,\u201c OeNB Executive Director Thomas Steiner seconded.\n\nImportantly, such developments and losses do not impair the OeNB's financial standing, nor do they compromise its ability to take action. The OeNB continued to fulfill all of its tasks in an effective manner in 2023. Apart from monetary policy, these comprise especially safeguarding financial stability, securing the smooth functioning of payment systems operating on Eurosystem market infrastructures, providing cash, producing top-quality statistics and preparing for a digital euro.\n\nTotal assets decreased, with operating result negative for the first time\n\n\u201eMonetary policy has also been the key driver of total asset growth,\u201d Thomas Steiner summed up the development of the OeNB's balance sheet and profit and loss account.\n\nTotal assets and total liabilities dropped by EUR 13 billion or 5% year on year, mainly as a result of monetary policy operations on both sides of the balance sheet. On the asset side, the balances outstanding under targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs III) continued to shrink significantly, from EUR 39 billion to EUR 15 billion, as operations matured or banks opted for early repayment. TLTRO III funding had been offered by the Eurosystem at three-year maturities from fall 2019 to December 2021, with strong take-up from Austrian credit institutions. On the liability side of the balance sheet, commercial banks\u2019 deposits were also on the decline.\n\nUltimately, the OeNB ended up recording an operating loss of \u2013EUR 2,211 million. This is a first, and mainly due to net interest income. Net interest income totaled \u2013EUR 2,043 million in 2023, which is a sharp deterioration from 2022. This deterioration is essentially due to the aforementioned asset liability mismatch. In other words, it is attributable to the spread between the fixed low yield of securities held for monetary policy purposes (EUR 494 million) on the asset side, and mounting interest expense given the prevailing deposit facility rate (\u2013EUR 3,476 million) on commercial banks\u2019 deposits held on the liability side. Beyond that, the OeNB\u2019s result was driven further into negative territory by interest expense on the OeNB\u2019s TARGET balances (\u2013EUR 2,633 million). This compares with EUR 2,066 million of interest income from the remuneration of intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem, and EUR 1,092 million of interest income from longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs III).\n\nThe OeNB\u2019s income from other sources, including its reserve investments, was above average but still insufficient to compensate for the negative net interest income. Like last year, the OeNB is therefore not in a position to pay out a profit share to the Austrian central government. From today\u2019s perspective, the financial burden resulting from the monetary policy-related asset liability mismatch is here to stay for some years, which means that it is going to affect the OeNB\u2019s financial result also in the years ahead. The OeNB\u2019s first balance sheet loss of EUR 2,062 million, attributable to monetary policy operations, will be carried forward to the financial year 2024, to be offset by future profits. This is why the OeNB will not be making any profit distributions to the central government in the coming years either. \u201eAs a central bank, the OeNB differs from companies and commercial banks, and it has been tasked by law with a clear mandate: The primary objective of the Eurosystem is to secure price stability. Losses have no impact on the ability to conduct effective monetary policy,\u201d Executive Director Steiner emphasized.\n\nAustria\u2019s economy in recession in 2023\n\nEconomic output in Austria had started to decline somewhat in the second half of 2022, on account of three factors: (1) pent-up demand from the COVID-19 pandemic was running out, (2) energy prices were going up and (3) the international environment was weak. In the second and third quarters of 2023, output then fell unexpectedly sharply and Austria slipped deeper into recession. The main drivers were marked drops in private consumption and investment, accompanied by a decline in exports. In late 2023, the dampening factors weakened and household incomes were increasingly supported by higher wage agreements. As a result, output growth stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2023. In sum, Austria\u2019s real GDP shrank by 0.7% in 2023.\n\nLooking ahead, the OeNB expects quarterly GDP growth rates to be slightly positive in 2024. The recovery is mainly driven by strengthening consumer demand; by contrast, investment is likely to contract further in 2024. We expect the Austrian economy to grow moderately by around \u00bd% in 2024, despite a weak start. Those are the latest projections, generated by the OeNB\u2019s interim economic forecast of March 2024.\n\nKey interest rates in the euro area raised to 4% in 2023\n\nIn 2023, monetary policymakers were up against the task of taking adequate monetary policy action to keep already elevated consumer prices from rising even higher, after inflation in the euro area as a whole had peaked at 8.4% in 2022. In 2023, inflation was going down: Monthly inflation rates as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) fell from 8.6% in January to 2.9% in December. Euro area inflation thus averaged 5.4% in 2023. The Eurosystem\u2019s macroeconomic projections, as updated in March 2024, point to inflation rates of 2.0% for 2025 and 1.9% for 2026.\n\nTo bring inflation down, the Governing Council of the ECB raised the key interest rates six times in 2023, from 2% to 4%. By the end of 2023, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations in the euro area stood at 4.50%, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility was 4.75%, and the interest rate on the deposit facility was 4.00%.\n\nHowever, it took more than the policy rate hikes to bring inflation down. By 2023, it had also become necessary to reduce the Eurosystem balance sheet, and hence also the OeNB\u2019s balance sheet. This is because large central bank holdings of securities dampen the level of medium to long-term interest rates. The Eurosystem\u2019s and the OeNB\u2019s monetary policy securities portfolios currently consist mainly of assets acquired under the asset purchase programme (APP) and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). In 2023, the Eurosystem started to shrink the APP portfolio at a measured pace, and the reduction will be continued in 2024. As of July 2023, maturing securities under the APP have no longer been replaced. In 2023, the OeNB\u2019s portfolio of APP assets thus decreased by EUR 3.8 billion, to EUR 71.6 billion. Meanwhile, the PEPP portfolio worth EUR 37.3 billion was sustained in full, in line with Eurosystem policy. That is to say, the principal payments of maturing securities were reinvested in full. This approach will be kept up in the first half of 2024. In the second half, the PEPP portfolio is expected to start to shrink moderately. As decided on December 14, 2023, the Governing Council of the ECB intends to discontinue reinvestments under the PEPP at the end of 2024. Last but not least, in 2023, the OeNB\u2019s total assets also declined due to the unwinding of TLTRO III refinancing operations.\n\nInflation markedly down in Austria\n\nIn Austria, HICP inflation peaked at 11.6% in January 2023. Thereafter, it gradually declined to 4.2% in February 2024. Our analysis shows that, in 2022, inflation was mainly driven by energy and other import prices. In late 2022, corporate profits had emerged as the key cost driver. From the second quarter of 2023, wages were accounting for roughly half of the price increases. As a result, the impact of nonenergy services and industrial goods on inflation increased, whereas the impact of energy and food prices was on the decline in 2023. This trend is expected to continue in 2024. According to our March 2024 forecast, we expect inflation to drop from 7.7% in 2023 to 3.6% in 2024, to 2.7% in 2025 and to 2.3% in 2026. And we project core inflation to exceed HICP inflation throughout the forecast horizon.\n\nResilient Austrian banking system holding steady amid challenging conditions\n\n\u201eThe Austrian banking system has become increasingly resilient thanks to steady microprudential supervision at the solo level and thanks to macroprudential measures aimed at enhancing systemic stability. In light of this, it continues to rank among the eleven most stable banking systems in the world,\u201c explained OeNB Vice Governor Gottfried Haber.\n\nIn 2023, banks were operating under challenging conditions, given armed conflicts, geopolitical tensions, elevated inflation, economic weakening and in particular banking turmoil in the USA and Switzerland. \u201eClearly, the manifold challenges and new risks that have emerged in recent years have driven home the benefits of forward-looking and targeted micro- and macroprudential banking supervision,\u201c Vice Governor Haber pointed out.\n\nAustrian banks not only mastered these challenges thanks to strengthened balance sheets, but they also managed to attain high profitability amid rising interest rates. A solid capital and liquidity base remains of the essence, and even more so in times of uncertainty. After all, the positive effects of the key interest rate hikes were felt immediately, while the negative effects in terms of deteriorating credit quality and the ensuing increase in risk costs and credit defaults occur only with a certain time lag.\n\nVice Governor Haber added that \u201edespite a difficult environment, the macroprudential measures were key in enhancing the perception of the Austrian banking sector and contributed to its top rating. S&P ratings therefore continue to rank the Austrian banking sector among the most stable in the world. This means that Austrian banks benefit from favorable refinancing costs, which they can pass on to their customers. By extension, the central and regional governments only pay low interest on their public debt.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, the OeNB stepped up its external communication on the riskiness of variable rate loans, after having closely monitored this type of loan for some time. In Austria, variable rate loans account for a significant share in financing. Even from mid-2015 to mid-2022, their share averaged out at 45% of newly originated housing loans to households. That is, during a period in which long-term interest rates were very low. At the end of 2023, their share again exceeded 50%. Variable rate loans harbor interest rate risk for borrowers. They put additional financial burdens on households in a situation, like we had in 2023: interest rates were on the rise and a weak economic environment caused real incomes to shrink. Austria\u2019s Financial Market Stability Board (FMSB) likewise explicitly highlighted the particular riskiness of variable rate loans in 2023.\n\nBorrower-based measures had been introduced in Austria already in August 2022, following international standards and recommendations. Since then, the lending standards for residential real estate loans have been improving markedly in Austria. For this reason, the risks related to residential real estate loans to households did not adversely affect financial stability when households, feeling the financial squeeze, faced a higher financial burden and real estate prices for the first time started to contract again.\n\nTrue to proactive supervision, microprudential and macroprudential supervisors continued in 2023 to keep close tabs on loans taken out to finance commercial real estate. The commercial real estate market was weighed down by several factors, namely rising interest rates, increased construction costs, shrinking real estate prices and the generally weak economic conditions. As a result, the banking sector recorded an increase in associated write-downs and credit losses, which were thoroughly analyzed and subject to inspections at both the systemic and the solo level. The supervisory focus on commercial real estate is set to continue also in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, banking sector profitability is likely to suffer from weaker credit growth, rising refinancing costs, e.g. on account of higher deposit rates, and deteriorating credit quality. In addition, banks are feeling the cost pressure of inflation. Accordingly, Vice Governor Haber advised banks \u201eto continue strengthening their capital base by using the high profits they earned in 2023 and to pay out dividends in a prudent, forward-looking and restrained manner.\u201c\n\nIn the statistics area, it is of note that, last year, the OeNB launched a transparency platform for savings account rates that compares the conditions offered by Austrian banks. We cooperated closely with representatives from Austrian banks and the Austrian Economic Chambers, which helped us implement the platform in a very short time frame. The platform provides a market overview of interest rates for overnight deposits as well as for deposits with lock-in periods of 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Users may determine at a glance whether their savings products match the current market conditions. The transparency platform is thus a first step in helping people optimize their investments, to be followed up by deeper dives on private and public comparison portals and by negotiations with their bank or other credit institutions.\n\nOeNB initiative to secure access to cash\n\n\u201eAustrians continue to strongly favor cash,\u201d confirmed OeNB Executive Director Eduard Schock. What they appreciate above all about cash is that it is an anonymous, resilient and secure means of payment. This is why some 95% of the domestic population cannot imagine a world without cash \u2013 notwithstanding the fact that digital payments have been becoming increasingly popular.\n\nIn line with its obligation to supply cash, the OeNB stands ready to meet the still high demand for euro banknotes. Above all, this also means ensuring continued free access to cash for cash users in Austria and leaving it at their discretion, as in the past, which payment instrument to use.\n\nCash in Austria continues to be highly accessible, with the network of automated teller machines (ATMs) remaining dense by international standards.\n\nNevertheless, it will take a dedicated effort to ensure that cash remains accessible throughout Austria also in the future. As a case in point, the number of ATMs has been going down by close to 6%, or some 500 machines, since 2021.\n\n\u201eIt will take extra efforts to secure and sustain today\u2019s excellent infrastructure. The OeNB for its part spares no efforts to proactively safeguard the continuous supply of cash,\u201c Executive Director Schock confirmed.\n\nIn 2023, we launched the \u201eBargeld-Board\u201d, which brings together officials from domestic banks to discuss strategic issues related to the supply of cash. The OeNB\u2019s latest initiative is a \u201ebasic cash supply model,\u201d to be negotiated with the banking community until the summer of 2024. Rather than focusing on absolute numbers of ATMs, this model has been designed to ensure reasonably local ATM access. The idea is to make sure ATMs will be within a reach of 1 kilometer for 67% of the population, within 2 kilometers for about 83% of the population, and within a radius of no more than 5 kilometers for 97% of the population.\n\nPreparations for the digital euro underway\n\nThe Eurosystem considers issuing a digital euro. Just like euro cash, a digital euro would be issued, protected and regulated by the ECB, and would thus be equally trustworthy. Governor Holzmann made the case for a digital euro, pointing out that \u201ecentral banks must ensure that money remains a public good and monetary policy remains independent. The idea is to make a digital euro available for day-to-day payments, as a digital form of central bank money that exists alongside cash and private sector payment instruments. It is meant to be a new affordable option for how to pay, for people in the euro area and beyond. Moreover, a digital euro is set to strengthen the euro area\u2019s monetary sovereignty. A strategically autonomous Europe would not depend on payment systems provided by non-European institutions, which may be of the essence in times of crisis.\u201d\n\nThe green light for moving into the preparation phase for the digital euro was given in mid-October 2023. In early 2024, the ECB already published the first calls for tender related to the issuance of a digital euro. The OeNB has committed itself to helping develop the technical components, alongside other Eurosystem central banks. \u201eBy the end of 2025, the digital euro project might be taken to the next level by the Governing Board of the ECB,\u201d Governor Holzmann explained.\n\nOeNB focuses on sustainable governance\n\nIn line with its corporate strategy, the OeNB attaches great importance to sustainability. Clearly, the only way forward for both the OeNB and its subsidiaries is to ensure sustainable business operations and to help protect the environment. The OeNB keeps an eye on how its activities impact on society and the environment \u2013 with a view to promoting sustainable development both in Austria and beyond. \u201eAs pledged in 2021, the OeNB as an institution aims to be carbon neutral by 2040 and to adjust its investment strategy accordingly until 2050,\u201d Governor Holzmann noted. \u201eAt present, we cooperate closely with international bodies to develop metrics and instruments to achieve the respective targets.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the press conference, Governor Robert Holzmann thanked the President, the Vice President and the other members of the General Council for their dedicated contributions. On behalf of the OeNB\u2019s General Council and Governing Board, he also thanked all members of staff for their ongoing outstanding commitment.",
