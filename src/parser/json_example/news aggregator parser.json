In December for example, he reinstated the accounts of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nX response\n\nElon Musk\u2019s X has not responded to this NBC News report or the research data, but on Monday the platform tweeted that the worldwide number is higher than what Sensor Tower data shows, with 250 million people using X every day globally.\n\nThat would still be a decrease from the stated 258 million users when Musk bought the app.\n\nX didn\u2019t respond to a request for additional information, NBC News reported.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right @XNews. 250 million people use X every day. 550 million people visit the global town square every month. On average, users spend 30 minutes a day on X. https://t.co/RoEX4RzIxL pic.twitter.com/L9mkoWll44 \u2014 Data (@XData) March 18, 2024\n\nX also said that 550 million people visit the global town square every month.\n\nAdvertising hit\n\nSensor Tower also reportedly said that advertisers have also left X, with 75 out of the top 100 US advertisers on X from October 2022 having ceased ad spending on it.\n\nThe exodus reportedly spiked toward the end of last year, after Musk publicly embraced an antisemitic conspiracy theory and then shocked everyone when he told advertisers at a conference in New York, \u201cGo f\u2014 yourself.\u201d\n\nMusk has recently urged his 177 million followers on X to get more people onto the platform.\n\nOn Sunday, Musk tweeted an encouragement for users to share X posts with friends, as \u201csome people still believe the legacy media!\u201d\n\nThreads downloads\n\nMeanwhile the NBC News report also cited research from Boston-based Apptopia that reportedly showed that due to the tight integration of Meta\u2019s Twitter rival Threads with Instagram, Threads beat X in downloads worldwide by an 8-to-1 ratio in February.\n\nDownloads were even more lopsided in the US in February, with Threads getting about 16 downloads for every one download of X, Apptopia reportedly said.\n\n\u201cFor microblogging platforms, X had dominant market share of app downloads right up until Threads launched,\u201d Tom Grant, vice president of research at Apptopia, reportedly wrote in an email. \u201cThat turned market share completely on its head.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Threads can turn these downloads into actual regular users.",

It started an investigation into potential greenwashing at the firms in the summer of 2022, saying it was worried that some clothes in the companies' ranges did in fact not meet green criteria.\n\nThe watchdog said at the time that it might take the businesses to court if their claims did not \"stack up\". But on Wednesday it announced it has instead come to an agreement where none of the firms admit any wrongdoing, but promise to follow a set of rules.\n\nAsos has a \"Responsible edit\" range, Boohoo sells clothes under \"Ready for the Future\", and Asda has \"George for Good\". In future, the criteria for inclusion in these ranges must be \"clearly set out and detail any minimum requirements,\" the CMA said.\n\n\"For example, if products need to contain a certain percentage of recycled fibres to be included in the range, this should be made clear,\" it said. Products must meet all criteria to be included in one of those ranges. ranges.\n\nThe companies have been advised not to use unclear words like eco, responsible or sustainable. Instead, they should go for more precise terms such as organic or recycled. In addition, those terms can only be used if specific requirements are met and the amount of recycled or organic materials in clothes has to be shown clearly.\n\nAlso, if a business has some green certification, it needs to specify whether that applies to specific products or their broader practices. Sarah Cardell, the boss of CMA, said: \"Following our action, the millions of people who shop with these well-known businesses can now have confidence in the green claims they see.\"\n\n\"This also marks a turning point for the industry. The commitments set a benchmark for how fashion retailers should be marketing their products, and we expect the sector as a whole from high street to designer brands to take note and review their own practices.\"",

      "article_text": "The Most Reliable Currency For Savings\n\nMoneymagpie Team 27th Mar 2024\n\nReading Time: 4 minutes\n\nInstability in the modern world affects the value of currency (dollars, euros, etc.) and the ability of people to protect themselves and maintain their lifestyle and business success. For people who are looking for reliable currencies to maintain stability, it is important to know about the most reliable ones. You can also improve your experience in money exchange \u2013 Rates is the most useful tool for this purpose. The service with which you can track currency exchange rates in financial institutions of Ukraine is available at any time of the day \u2013 from the USA to Canada.\n\nWhat Determines The Price of a Currency?\n\nTrade has been around for quite some time. When it entered a stable channel, the first money began to emerge. They were made of gold and silver, and there was no talk of a national currency yet. Each penny had a real weight, which directly affected its value.\n\nIt took a long time before people realized that using precious metals was too expensive. And paper money came into circulation. They cannot be printed in unlimited quantities. There should be exactly as much paper money as the country\u2019s gold and foreign exchange reserves can cover.\n\nBased on these factors, as well as the degree of development of the state\u2019s economy, investment attractiveness, and other nuances, the value of the national currency is determined. The most expensive currencies are the money of countries with developed economies.\n\nThe Best Currencies In The World For Stability\n\nThe vast majority of people are predominantly focused on the dollar and euro. But there are many other currencies in the world that are no less stable.\n\nSwiss Francs (CHF)\n\nThe Swiss currency is quite expensive. Frank is not prone to sudden jumps and fluctuations. When there is a crisis around the world, the Swiss franc still grows naturally. This stability has led to the fact that the inflation rate in the country in recent decades does not exceed 0.5\u20130.6%.\n\nKuwaiti Dinar (KWD)\n\nThis is the most expensive world currency and has held this position for almost 20 years. The reason is the state\u2019s leading position in global oil production. The cost of one Kuwaiti dinar is very high.\n\nBahraini Dinar (BHD)\n\nThe high price, as with the Kuwaiti dinar, is ensured by the leading position of the state in global oil production.\n\nOmani Rial (OMR)\n\nThe State of Oman is an absolute monarchy. There is no unemployment or homelessness here. The standard of living of citizens is high and constantly growing. This ensures the high stability of the national currency.\n\nThe value of one Omani rial is approximately the same as the Bahraini dinar.\n\nJapanese Yen (JPY)\n\nIt is one of the ten most stable world currencies. Almost 20% of global transactions are secured by the Japanese yen. Even a nuclear disaster could not undermine the stability of the national currency.\n\nPound Sterling (GBP)\n\nThis currency is considered one of the most attractive for forming savings. For many states, it is a reserve one. The exchange rate is quite high \u2013 higher than the euro or US dollar.\n\nEuro (EUR)\n\nOne of the youngest, but quite stable currencies. Very prone to jumps and fluctuations, but for many countries it is a reserve. Despite some instability, it will not lose its importance in the global economy.\n\nUS Dollar (USD)\n\nIt is the most popular and sought-after currency in the world. An impressive share of international transactions cannot be done without the dollar. Quite a few states conduct internal transactions in dollars.\n\nAnd although the United States no longer has gold and foreign exchange reserves, the dollar is unlikely to fall to critical levels.\n\nSwedish Krona (SEK)\n\nThere are practically no people in the country who live below the poverty line. The state actively pays benefits to people with low incomes. Despite the stability of the economy, the crown exchange rate is quite unstable \u2013 it reacts to any fluctuations in the economy.\n\nAustralian Dollar (AUD)\n\nA stable currency, it is national for the mainland and adjacent islands. The Australian dollar is doing well in the international economy.\n\nAnalysts consider the Swiss franc to be the most stable currency. It is officially used for payments as the national currency in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Besides that, Swiss banks are also considered the most reliable banks in the world. The stability of the banking system and the country\u2019s strong economy provide the franc with the status of a safe currency.\n\nThe franc is pegged to gold, one of the most stable precious metals. According to international analysts, this directly affects the currency\u2019s stability.\n\nThe Swiss economy is also quite stable. The inflation rate over the past decade has not exceeded 0.6%. And although it rose to 2.2% during the pandemic, this did not in any way affect the stability of national money.\n\nThe Norwegian krone also shows stability. Norway has virtually no external debt. But when oil prices began to rise, the exchange rate dropped noticeably.\n\nThe Singapore dollar has no connection with the EU, but regularly appears on lists of the most reliable currencies. The state has a loyal tax system, which greatly attracts international investors. Recently, large Chinese businesses have been moving to Singapore.\n\nCompared to Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have become very popular for investing and saving, the currencies discussed in the article are extremely reliable. If you are looking at currency as a means to create a financial cushion, then you can also look at other means of providing security against unforeseen situations \u2013 for example, purchasing an Aetna insurance policy.\n\nConclusion\n\nBefore making savings in a particular currency, you need to carefully study the situation on the world market and study the opinions of analysts. We also recommend using the Rates.fm service to track the exchange rate of currencies in financial institutions of Ukraine.

European investors spent almost \u20ac15bn on equity-dedicated ETFs in February yet removed over \u20ac10bn from mutual funds in the same sector.\n\nSince the start of the year, mutual funds have had positive inflows of \u20ac16.7bn from European investors, but this was overshadowed by the \u20ac37.1bn received by ETFs over the period.\n\nMovements such as these could imply that European investors are selling actively-managed products in favour of passive vehicles.\n\nThe report\u2019s author and head of Lipper\u2019s head of EMEA research Detlef Glow said that \u201cone could agree with this thesis\u201d given the trend in flows this year, but investors should wait for more evidence before drawing a solid conclusion just yet.\n\nNevertheless, Glow said it is worth noting that not all passive products are ETFs \u2013 almost all the inflows going into mutual funds this year went to passive products.\n\nThese vehicles received \u20ac16.6bn in the first three months of 2024 while active mutual funds made a modest \u20ac0.1bn.\n\nAlthough investors cannot be certain whether this trend will persist, Glow said that there was a distinctively \u201clarge margin\u201d between the two this year.\n\nSee also: Why European stocks could benefit most from revived risk appetite\n\nOverall, bond funds were at the top of European investors\u2019 shopping lists in February, raking in \u20ac31.4bn of fresh inflows throughout the month.\n\nDespite these strong inflows, Glow urged some caution, stating: \u201cThere are still some concerns about the possibility of a recession in the US and other major economies around the globe. These fears have been raised by a lack of growth in some economies and the long-term inverted yield curves, which are seen as an early indicator for a possible recession.\n\n\u201cThe normalisation of inverted yield curves might be another short-term challenge for the bond markets.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the vigour in which European investors have bought equity funds this year could slow as people question just how long the US rally can continue for.\n\n\u201cThe performance of these stocks might have reminded some investors of the performance of some stocks before the burst of the dot-com bubble,\u201d Glow said. \u201cAs a result, many investors might have been caught between fear and greed when looking at the US equity markets.\u201d\n\nSee also: Co-manager of JP Morgan Indian trust steps down to take CEO role",

      "article_text": "BUILDING owners and operators are unknowingly sitting on valuable assets that could unlock \u2018significant\u2019 energy, carbon, and cost savings, according to experts across the built environment sector.\n\nA whitepaper published by Glasgow-based climate technology firm IES suggests that reinstating existing 3D design, energy compliance or BIM models created during a building\u2019s development could be key to reaching net zero goals.\n\nBringing together voices from organisations including the UK Green Building Council (UKGBC), HLM Architects, the University of Glasgow, SWECO, and Perth & Kinross Council, the paper argues for putting an existing compliance energy model through further modelling stages and combining it with actual data from the building itself to create a Performance Digital Twin. This process has been coined as the Sleeping Digital Twin theory by IES.\n\nFor building owners and operators, a Performance Digital Twin is designed to enable a greater understanding of a building\u2019s in-use performance. 64% of building owners, occupiers and managers asked in the accompanying survey to this whitepaper see the benefit of using energy models for more efficient ongoing maintenance, with 66% citing the main benefit as supporting the achievement of net zero goals.\n\nFurther savings can be made by using the model to test different retrofit and renovation options before the work is undertaken.\n\nAdvancements in technology have enabled Digital Twins to be linked to live operational data for continuous tracking and improvement of building performance. This enables facilities managers to identify where energy savings can be made and ensure improvements are delivering expected savings.\n\nA Performance Digital Twin can support the attainment of in-use performance certifications such as NABERS and BREEAM. It can also be used to support post-occupancy evaluation studies.\n\nThe whitepaper also explores the barriers to uptake. 66% of respondents see the biggest hurdle to using energy models in operation as the associated cost. 54% of building owners and operators feel there is a lack of required skills to take on the use of models if they are handed over.\n\nAnother significant barrier to utilising existing models is gaining access to them. Only 23% of architects, engineers and contractors surveyed said they currently hand over models once a building is complete. Reasons for this include clients not asking for them in briefs, legal implications, and the belief that clients lack the skills to be able to manage the models. To address this, IES has created a guide which focuses on the current practicalities of creating a Performance Digital Twin when there is no access to existing digital assets.\n\nDon McLean, CEO at IES, said, \u201cBuilding owners spend money getting digital models developed as part of contracting a building design but when it\u2019s complete these are often shelved and left dormant. Optimising the model to be used in the building\u2019s operational stages means that a building owner is maximising its value to identify where improvements can be made to futureproof the building, drive down costs and meet net zero goals.\n\n\u201cOnce a Performance Digital Twin has been created from an existing model, it can be linked up to a live dashboard through technology such as our new IES Live tool, to enable building managers to monitor, adjust and optimise the operation of a building continuously. Despite this, many building owners and operators aren\u2019t aware that an energy model even exists for their building, let alone that it could be transformed into a Performance Digital Twin.\n\n\u201cAs such, the first step in encouraging the uptake of this approach is educating clients on the fact that they have these models and the benefits they can bring. Then, there is a job to do to upskill building management teams to be able to use these digital assets effectively to reap the rewards. AEC professionals have a key role to play in helping to raise awareness and educate clients, as well as upskilling themselves to advance energy modelling.\u201d\n\nThe full whitepaper, which includes viewpoints from the UKGBC, CIBSE, Introba, SWECO, Gafcon Digital, HOK, HLM Architect, Perth & Kinross Council, The University of Birmingham, and the University of Glasgow, is available to read here.",

However, unlike NFTs, Ordinals, Counterparty assets, or any other type of prior art, Marathon simply ordered transactions in a precise pattern. This block of ordered transactions rendered as a pixelated image on block indexer websites like Mempool.space.\n\nMany Bitcoiners shared the image, a corporate advertisement for Marathon, and as such, its media campaign worked. However, Marathon had to forgo some transaction fee revenue in order to carefully craft its block template with less competitively priced transactions.\n\nMarathon compensated by increasing public awareness of its block template-building and mining skills.\n\nThe organizer of one Bitcoin conference poked fun, noting that the ad was uncentered by one pixel. The ad also failed to render on certain block indexers. Nevertheless, its message was communicated clearly enough to thousands of observers.\n\nMarathon ordered transactions in a precise pattern, however, its artwork was apparently one pixel out.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin miners increasingly rely on government handouts to compete\n\nAlthough the rendering and ordering of pixels into particular dimensions is not a consensus-level decision enforced by Bitcoin full nodes, block indexers\u2019 standard convention made it a convenient canvas for Marathon\u2019s art.\n\nBecause Marathon owns its own mining pool and uses its own block templates, it was able to create a custom graphic that didn\u2019t involve any NFT, Ordinal, or Counterparty protocols.\n\nThe Bitcoin block number is 836361.

      "article_text": "The state pension will rise by 8.5 per cent in a matter of weeks but many older Britons could be \u201cpushed into\u201d paying more tax as a result.\n\nThis is because of the \u201cstealth tax\u201d levied on Britons through the impact of fiscal drag.\n\nEarlier this year, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt reiterated the Government\u2019s promise to maintain the triple lock on retirement benefits. While this decision has been praised by pensioners, experts are sounding the alarm over the potential consequences of this decision. Henrietta Grimston, a financial planning director at Evelyn Partners, said the 8.5 per cent boost from April 6 would be \u201cvery welcome\u201d for people drawing the state pension. However, she said the rise \u201ccould also push some recipients into paying tax, or into a higher tax threshold\u201d. Do you have a money story you\u2019d like to share? Get in touch by emailing money@gbnews.uk.\n\nState pensioners could be dragged into paying more tax for the first time GETTY\n\nUnder the triple lock, state pensions increase annually by the highest out of the rate of average earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent. With an 8.5 per cent increase, the full state pension would be raised from the current \u00a310,600.20 a year to \u00a311,501.22 in April 2024. However, this hiked payment could lead to older Britons being liable to pay more tax due to the impact of fiscal drag. This is the term used to describe when someone\u2019s wages or income rise while tax allowances remain at the same level.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s Autumn Budget, Mr Hunt confirmed that tax thresholds would remain frozen until the 2027/28 tax year. No one pays tax on income which is below the personal allowance - which has been frozen at \u00a312,570 since 2021-22. Analysis from Standard Life determined that the full state pension will go from accounting for 70 per cent of the personal allowance in 2019-2020 to an expected 92 per cent in 2024-25. Steve Webb, the former pensions minister and partner at Lane Clark & Peacock (LCP), believes \u201cmillions will be dragged\u201d into paying income tax for the first time.",

      "article_text": "Inverclyde Council is set to freeze its council tax despite initially arguing with the Scottish government on the issue.\n\nThe residents in Inverclyde will receive a reduction in their council tax bills to offset the cost of an 8.2 per cent hike after councillors agreed a one-off credit for 2024/25 financial year.\n\nThey agreed today to approve credit which will be paid into thousands of council tax accounts to cut their bills. The money will pass straight onto residents as a one-off credit to offset the council tax increase this year. It will offset the 8.2 per cent increase that was approved as part of the budget last month. The council previously contested the council tax freeze, stating the move would minimise job and services cuts, and would set a balanced budget.\n\nYousaf had announced a national council tax freeze at the SNP conference in October GETTY\n\nCouncilor Stephen McCabe, leader of Inverclyde Council and convener of policy and resources, said: \u201cWhile I would far rather the council had the freedom to spend the additional \u00a32.9million as we saw fit, I am pleased that after intense negotiations with the deputy First Minister and government officials we have been able to reach an agreement with the Scottish Government that means this money will come to Inverclyde rather than be spent on other Scottish Government priorities. \u201cLast month, the council exercised its democratic right to increase council tax as part of a two-year budget to minimise cuts to jobs and services and fulfil our legal obligation to set a balanced budget. \u201cThat was the right decision at the time and was taken in the best interests of the council and the people of Inverclyde. \u201cWhat that meant was that we did not accept the Government\u2019s original offer to implement a council tax freeze.\u201d\n\nAround 29,000 council tax accounts will now receive the credit. New bills will be calculated and distributed during May to households by letter or online, depending on how they have opted to receive their council tax bills. With council tax rates already agreed for the 2024/2025 year, residents will initially pay more until the credit kicks in \u2013 then they will see payments reduced. Mr McCabe continued: \u201cMore money has since become available towards a council tax freeze, which would not have been offered had we and two other small councils not made a stand, and we lobbied the government for that money because it was earmarked specifically for Inverclyde and belongs to the people of Inverclyde who pay their taxes.\n\n\"I really do hope that the Scottish Government learns a lesson from this year\u2019s budget process. They may have secured a national council tax freeze but that has come at a significant price.\u201d Inverclyde, along with Argyll and Bute, had previously agreed to go against proposals outlined by the first minister, Humza Yousaf last month. They had also agreed to a six percent hike in the year 2025/26. It would have meant properties in Band A paying an extra \u00a31.50 a week and those in Band D going up by \u00a3117 to \u00a31547 a year - a rise of \u00a32.25 a week. Mr McCabe, said the government had \"badly damaged its relationship\" with local authority governing body COSLA and urged them to take lessons from the negotiations. A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u201cScottish ministers are aware that many councils are under financial pressure, which is why the 2024-25 Scottish budget provides record funding for local government of over \u00a314 billion.

      "article_text": "In a move aimed at enhancing the living conditions for private renters, Brent, a borough in northwest London, is set to implement a comprehensive landlord licensing scheme starting from the next week.\n\nA Leap Towards Better Housing\n\nThe forthcoming borough-wide mandate will necessitate all landlords in Brent, with the exception of those in Wembley Park, to obtain a legal license for every privately rented property from 1 April onwards. This initiative underscores the council\u2019s commitment to improving the standards of private rental accommodations, ensuring safety, and clarifying the obligations of landlords and agents in property management.\n\nCllr Promise Knight, the cabinet member for Housing, Homelessness and Renters\u2019 Security, expressed enthusiasm about the scheme\u2019s potential to uplift living standards for the substantial segment of Brent\u2019s population that relies on private renting. \u201cThis is a scheme that will bring about positive living standard improvements for private renters who make up half of all Brent residents. It will also give landlords and agents complete clarity on their responsibilities regarding property management and safety,\u201d Knight stated.\n\nHighlighting the council\u2019s readiness to collaborate with compliant landlords while issuing a stern warning to those who flout the regulations, Knight added, \u201cThe introduction of selective licensing across Brent will offer renters the assurance of security and safety when it comes to their homes. We will continue to work in partnership with good professional landlords to help them comply with regulations. But any landlord who ignores the law should be aware that there will be nowhere in Brent for them to hide.\u201d\n\nBrent\u2019s proactive stance on housing regulation is further evidenced by its track record of issuing the first banning order in 2023 against a non-compliant landlord, barring him from letting houses in England for five years. Moreover, Brent stands out for licensing a higher number of homes of multiple occupation than any other London borough, supported by one of the capital\u2019s most active enforcement teams.\n\nThis new licensing scheme is poised to be a pivotal step in Brent\u2019s ongoing efforts to ensure a safer, more secure, and higher quality living environment for its private renters.",

The intake of steers is up 4%, with heifers showing an increase of 5%.\n\nThe young bull supply is back 4.5% on last year, which amounts to 1,700 fewer being supplied in 2024.\n\nThe weekly supply of heifers is also showing a substantial increase on last year at 14.7% more this year, while the pattern of steers being supplied weekly is more in line with the year to date at 4% over 2023.\n\nThe intake at the factories tightened last week to 33,106 head, reflecting the shorter working week with the national holiday on Monday, even though many of the plants are not operating their slaughtering line for full five-day weeks generally at present.\n\nLast week's supply included 12,017 steers, 9,296 heifers, 7,605 cows, and 1,706 young bulls.",

      "article_text": "The Bank of England (BofE) has welcomed progress in improving the level of resilience in liability-driven investment (LDI) funds, while its Systemic Risk Survey has revealed improved confidence in the stability of the UK financial system.\n\n\n\nThe BofE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) previously outlined its key recommendations following issues with LDI funds in autumn 2022, suggesting that The Pensions Regulator (TPR) should take action \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to mitigate financial stability risks by specifying the minimum levels of resilience for LDI funds.\n\n\n\nThe FPC's latest Financial Policy Summary and Record provided an update its work to improve operational resilience, again highlighting the LDI stress in September 2022 as a key example of a period of financial instability during which operational issues amplified the initial financial stress.\n\n\n\nThe report explained that, during this episode of market volatility, the replenishment of LDI funds\u2019 liquidity buffers was hindered by firms\u2019 operational arrangements, and in some cases by the governance processes at pension schemes, exacerbating liquidity issues and the need to sell assets in stressed conditions.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the FPC said that some custody banks that provide services to these funds struggled to keep pace with the volume and complexity of requests, with the operational complexities of making and receiving large volumes of collateral calls during periods of significant market volatility amplifying market stress.\n\n\n\nHowever, the FPC said that it \u201cwelcomed progress made against its November 2022 and March 2023 recommendations\u201d since then, specifically highlighting TPR\u2019s guidance on the use of leveraged LDI strategies.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere had been continued progress in the implementation of the resilience standard the FPC recommended for LDI funds, and several steps had been taken by authorities to ensure that it would be met on an ongoing basis,\u201d the report stated.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe FPC observed that this resilience standard was continuing to function well, with funds maintaining higher levels of resilience compared with prior to the LDI episode in September 2022.\n\n\n\n\"Areas for improvement that FPC had identified in its October 2023 record, including slow recapitalisation periods by some LDI managers, were being addressed via collaboration between domestic and international authorities.\"\n\n\n\nIn particular, the FPC welcomed recent consultations by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) and Luxembourg\u2019s Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) on macroprudential measures for sterling LDI funds, suggesting that, if put into effect, these measures would complement existing guidance by UK authorities to maintain the resilience of the LDI sector.\n\n\n\nThe FPC also welcomed TPR\u2019s efforts to enhance its data collection and capabilities and ongoing collaboration between UK authorities on LDI data monitoring, arguing that addressing data gaps and embedding the more regular use of data analytics is \"essential\" to building a deeper understanding of vulnerabilities and resilience in the LDI sector as well as market-based finance more broadly.\n\n\n\nThe report also provided an update on the BofE's plans to tackle systemic risks in market-based finance by developing a new facility to allow it to lend to insurance companies and pension funds (ICPFs), including newly-resilient LDI funds.\n\n\n\nThe report stated: \"The FPC welcomed ongoing work to strengthen the Bank\u2019s toolkit to intervene where liquidity-related dysfunction in core sterling markets threatened financial stability.\n\n\n\nThe report stated: \"In system-wide stress scenarios where non-banking financial institution (NBIFs) were seeking temporary liquidity, it was preferable, where possible, to backstop market functioning by lending directly to NBFIs against high quality collateral, rather than with asset purchases. This presented less risk to public funds and less moral hazard.\n\n\n\n\"The FPC noted that the first step in this process would be to design a facility that will enable the Bank to lend to eligible pension funds, insurance companies and LDI funds against UK gilts in times of system-wide stress.\"\n\n\n\nIt also suggested that, over time, the BofE will consider how this tool might be broadened to include a wider range of NBIFs as counterparties.\n\n\n\nTPR welcomed the Bank's latest report, with chief executive, Nausicaa Delfas, stating: \u201cWe welcome the FPC\u2019s recent announcement recognising the progress TPR has made in response to its recommendations on making the leveraged LDI market more resilient to gilt market shocks.\n\n\n\n\u201cTPR will continue to work with the Bank of England and other regulatory partners to ensure any risks to financial stability in the pensions sector are reduced\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe BofE also published the key results from its Systemic Risk Survey, which includes views from pension schemes, UK banks and building societies, large foreign banks, asset managers, hedge funds, insurers, and large non-financial companies.\n\n\n\nThis showed that survey respondents remain confident in the stability of the UK financial system, reporting a similar level of confidence to 2023 H2.\n\n\n\nThe perceived probability of a high-impact event affecting the UK financial system in both the short term and medium term had also fallen further.\n\n\n\nGeopolitical risk and cyber attack remained the most frequently cited risks among participants, with 85 per cent of respondents citing geopolitical risk as one of the top five risks they thought would have the greatest impact on the UK financial system, while 70 per cent identified a cyber attack as one of their top five concerns.\n\nShare Story:",

      "article_text": "Amadeus chief financial officer Till Streichert is hugely optimistic about the prospects for aviation, but he tells ABN the need for cutting-edge technology has never been greater\n\nIt won\u2019t come as a surprise that a former telecoms executive believes stridently that advances in technology are key if aviation is to meet growing demand for flying in the post-Covid world.\n\nBut for Till Streichert, who joined tech giant Amadeus as chief finance officer in the midst of the greatest challenge the sector has ever faced, the vision for an industry now in recovery is clear.\n\nHe sees embracing digitalisation and automation as vital if a sector that is constrained by supply-related shortages in terms of people, aircraft and airport capacity is to achieve the growth being demanded of it.\n\nSpeaking to Aviation Business News on a visit to London last week, Streichert said recovery from the pandemic has come slower than some had hoped but that Covid is now firmly behind us.\n\n\u201cThere were a number of many waves of Covid and many players in the industry in 2020 had hoped recovery would be quicker than we\u2019ve seen, but here we are in 2024. Travel is fully back.\n\n\u201c2023 was still a year of recovery, but you just have to look at Iata figures to see we are back to 2019 levels. There are some pockets, like Asia Pacific, where we are going to see additional growth.\n\n\u201cBut some regions are already beyond pre-Covid levels \u2013 look at north America. What matters most is growth prospects in the medium and long term. Covid has shown us there is a desire to travel. You can see that everywhere.\u201d\n\nStreichert says he has never regretted the decision to swap the relative security of the telecoms sector, which boomed during Covid, for aviation, which spent much of the pandemic grounded.\n\nHe made the decision to leave Vodafone\u2019s South African subsidiary Vadacom to join Amadeus prior to the pandemic hitting and admits it was a \u201cchallenging time\u201d for all in the sector, but he says \u201cthe travel industry is a great place to be\u201d.\n\n\u201cTravel has got something that\u2019s genuinely very positive because it connects people, it connect societies. When I joined the industry I was impressed by the dynamic in the travel sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fragmented and you have a lot of players that support the traveller\u2019s journey from the start when they are searching and booking through to the airport and border control when they fly and then when they collect their luggage and arrive at their hotel.\n\n\u201cBut the dynamic and desire to be forward looking, powered by travel demand, that was something I found very positive.\u201d\n\nIt is this complex eco-system of interdependent providers that gives a company like Amadeus an opportunity to support aviation and travel\u2019s efforts to operate more effectively and efficiently.\n\nAmadeus\u2019s software and IT systems are embedded throughout the industry and this is where the company, which employs more than 18,000 people, \u201cadds value\u201d to the airline sector, according to Streichert.\n\n\u201cOf course, all of these players in the market have to live off what\u2019s available in terms of margin, but it comes down to the question of are you offering something which people want to do, something which people are looking to buy from you. And that\u2019s why the demand for travel is very powerful.\u201d\n\nAmadeus is listed on the Spanish stock exchange but has operations globally, a legacy of its airline Global Distribution System (GDS) heritage that remains a core part of its business.\n\nLast year it reported that it spent more than \u20ac1 billion on IT and Research and Development (R&D), a 12.9% year-on-year growth and something that puts the company among Europe\u2019s highest investors in tech.\n\nStreichert says this is vitally important for a company that needs to be seen as offering \u201ccutting edge\u201d solutions to its customers, particularly in emerging areas like biometrics and Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nHe believes 2024 will be a year in which these technologies will mature and more live use cases for aviation will emerge that will spur further testing and roll out. Amadeus recently announces the proposed \u20ac320 million acquisition of biometrics specialist Vision Box.\n\n\u201cEverything starts with where we provide value to the airlines and to the overall travel industry. That\u2019s what we base our investments on, and I\u2019m convinced that they will yield good returns,\u201d said Streichert.\n\n\u201cFor us, Research and Development is fundamental to evolve the technology and to modernise so we have cutting edge solutions for our customers. If you look at the history of Amadeus it\u2019s a story of growth powered by investment in technology. Investment in R&D is in the DNA of Amadeus.\u201d\n\nIn the area of payments, Amadeus launched specialist subsidiary OutPayce last year to help its customer orchestrate their payments in what is today a much more diverse, complex and global marketplace.\n\nAnother recent deal announced was of Voxel, an electronic invoice and B2B payment solutions provider, which Amadeus will acquire for a reported \u20ac113 million.\n\nAnd Amadeus itself has undergone the biggest technology transformation in its history moving much of its IT infrastructure off mainframe servers and to the cloud in a partnership with Microsoft that will apply its expertise in AI and other emerging tech to develop the aviation IT systems of the future.\n\nDue to the nature of technological advances, IT investment priorities have changed over the year. The move to Iata\u2019s New Distribution Capability (NDC) has been a recent priority and now the focus is on Amadeus\u2019 \u201cmodern airline retailing\u201d platform Nevio.\n\nStreichert says: \u201cWhen you think about the tech side of modern retailing, two years ago we, and many others in the sector, were still asking questions about what\u2019s to come and what will modern retailing look like.\n\n\u201cNow, in 2024, we are dealing much more with the question of how we start implementing it and making it real.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we are seeing. We have launch partners like Finnair, and Saudia expressing an interest, and more airlines interested in understanding what this means for the industry.\n\n\u201cThis year is much more of a year of making it happen rather than thinking about the concept. This is something I feel very strongly about. In the end it\u2019s all about digitalisation and automation.\u201d",

      "article_text": "Georgian pianist Giorgi Gigashvili is the latest winner of the Terence Judd-Hall\u00e9 Award.\n\nBBC Radio 3 has selected Gigashvili as the latest winner of the coveted award as part of the BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artists scheme. The prize includes exciting concerto and chamber performance opportunities during the Hall\u00e9\u2019s 2024-25 Manchester Season, which will be announced on Thursday 2 May.\n\nThe prize also features at least one concerto performance with the Hall\u00e9 at The Bridgewater Hall, a chamber recital with Hall\u00e9 musicians at Hall\u00e9 St Peter\u2019s, a solo recital as part of the Manchester Mid-Day Concert Series and a cash prize of \u00a37,000.\n\nGigashvili was born in Tbilisi, Georgia, in 2000 and studied at the Tbilisi State Conservatory. He has already won major prizes in Spain, Italy, Zurich and Israel and adds the Terence-Judd-Hall\u00e9 Award as his first UK-based prize. His debut album Meeting My Shadow was released in April 2023 to great critical acclaim.\n\nGigashvili said of the award: \u201cWhen you are at the beginning of your musical career, you are so incredibly happy and grateful for support and awards like this. I feel very honoured, it motivates me to continue and makes me happy. I also look forward to playing with the outstanding Hall\u00e9 Orchestra and getting to know its musicians better. I know about the history and the tragic life of Terence and after receiving this award I became immensely touched with the feeling that he started breathing in me and now I have a duty to fulfil his ideas and dreams.\u201d\n\nDavid Butcher, Hall\u00e9 chief executive, added: \u201cWe are delighted to announce Giorgi Gigashvili as this year\u2019s recipient of the Terence Judd-Hall\u00e9 Award, continuing the memory of one of our nation\u2019s most exceptional young pianists and continuing our flourishing partnership with BBC Radio 3. I am very much looking forward to welcoming Giorgi to Manchester and enjoying his Hall\u00e9 debuts at The Bridgewater Hall and Hall\u00e9 St Peter\u2019s during the 2024-25 Season.\u201d\n\nSam Jackson, controller BBC Radio 3 and BBC Proms, said: \u201cThe BBC New Generation Artists scheme turns 25 this year. Since 1999, we have nurtured and promoted over 100 young instrumentalists, singers and ensembles at the start of their international careers, through studio recordings, commissions of new work, broadcasts on BBC Radio 3 and performances at venues and festivals all over the country.\n\nOur partnership with the Hall\u00e9 has been crucial, and we congratulate Giorgi Gigashvili on being the next recipient of the Terence Judd-Hall\u00e9 Award. The ongoing link between the New Generation Artists scheme and the Hall\u00e9 will create further opportunities for collaboration with outstanding musicians, providing memorable experiences for audiences both in the concert hall and on BBC Radio 3.\u201d\n\n\n\nTerence Judd was a remarkably gifted British pianist who passed away aged 22 as he was about to embark on a historic tour of the Soviet Union. A trust was established in 1982, and for over four decades, the Terence Judd-Hall\u00e9 award has been presented in his honour. Celebrated pianists such as Sir Stephen Hough, Nikolai Lugansky, Elisabeth Brauss, and last year\u2019s recipient, Tom Borrow, have been notable beneficiaries of the award.",

      "article_text": "Emerging markets sovereign debt, as an asset class, is still set to deliver strong performance for 2024, says Polina Kurdyavko, head of emerging markets at RBC BlueBay Asset Management.\n\nWhile emerging markets are intrinsically linked to overall global macro conditions, the direction of which remain difficult to predict, EM sovereign debt as an asset class is still primed to deliver strong performance \u2013 and therefore alpha \u2013 for 2024. This is particularly the case for those investors who are willing to be both nimble in their approach and long-term in their investment time horizon.\n\nAfter a few rocky years, 2023 proved to be an exceptional year for EM debt, yielding double-digit gains across both sovereign credit and local debt. And while 2024 may hold some surprises in store, both in terms of monetary and fiscal policy dispersions and the volume of elections taking place across the globe, we believe the asset class offers numerous opportunities.\n\nA golden opportunity\n\nThe first, and arguably most important, relates to improving fundamentals. Fuelled by a prolonged period of high commodity prices, particularly during the pandemic, many EMs have managed to reduce their fiscal and current account deficits. Meanwhile, global tourism has picked up, helping countries such as Turkey and the Caribbean to bring in additional revenue and taxes.\n\nOn top of that, EMs are displaying positive signs of growth, helping metrics like debt-to-GDP ratios to fall slightly. According to both our projections and of the IMF, EM countries will continue to see significantly higher-than-expected growth rates than advanced economies.\n\nConcurrently, inflationary trends continue to show improvement across the EM universe (with certain exceptions). Unlike their counterparts, many EM central banks have been running a mostly orthodox set of monetary policies since 2020, raising their interest rates long before their counterparts in advanced economies. This puts them ahead of the curve, instead of lagging behind.\n\nFrom the perspective of rating cycles, there were no sovereign defaults in 2023 and the risk of defaults remains concentrated in smaller countries. For these reasons, we believe the asset class is now past its default rate peak \u2013 a sentiment reflected by the strong investor appetite for those bonds already issued in 2024 and the subsequent rally in the market.\n\nEven though forecasting total return can be a perilous proposition, we think investors should be comfortable with the fact that high carry offers the potential to offset quite a bit of volatility, should it transpire.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, our view is that many distressed assets in EM are trading at a discount and should produce strong returns, especially with carry still close to 13-year highs.\n\nAccording to our analysis, the probability of the asset class producing a positive total return on a one-year forward looking basis is quite strong. In nine scenarios of spread and 10-year Treasury levels, only three out of these 81 symmetrically simulated scenarios showed negative total return at the index level (assuming no further unexpected defaults, as is our base case for this asset class).\n\nTherefore, even though forecasting total return can be a perilous proposition, we think investors should be comfortable with the fact that high carry offers the potential to offset quite a bit of volatility, should it transpire. This is a material difference compared to other core investment grade asset classes, which provide far lower levels of carry.\n\nThat said, the investment outlook somewhat hinges on the ultimate trajectory of US Treasuries, which are notoriously difficult to predict. We do, however, observe that US fixed mortgage rates are the highest they have been in the last 23 years, a period in which the US has experienced at least two pronounced recessions. The yield curve, too, appears to indicate economic softness through pronounced inversion.\n\nA year of elections\n\nWith roughly half of the world\u2019s population heading to the polls this year, there are several key elections that could impact both regional and global outlooks and, in turn, present significant geopolitical risk in EMs over the course of the year.\n\nThe most impactful will likely be the US presidential election when the return of Trump is looking increasingly probable. Indeed, history would suggest that a Trump presidency may very well inject further uncertainty and spike global market volatility, whether it be through tough rhetoric on China or agitating the world\u2019s economic institutions. Yet despite the volatility ahead, EMs still present a compelling case for investors looking to add exposure to the asset class.\n\nClearly, there are exciting opportunities within EM sovereign debt for investors seeking diversification and growth potential. However, the political and economic challenges have not disappeared and so tapping into this asset class requires selectivity, in-depth knowledge, and extreme agility.\n\nInvestors would, therefore, do well to take an active approach, combining top-down macro analysis and bottom-up fundamental assessment, to enhance returns and reduce risk.\n\n*Polina Kurdyavko is head of emerging markets at RBC BlueBay Asset Management.",

However, it has no product fee.\n\nOn the typical \u00a3200,000 first-time buyer mortgage that would equate to paying \u00a31,170 a month, if repaying over a 25 year term.\n\nThe mortgage won't be available for purchasing flats or new build properties.\n\nThose who apply will also be subject to rigorous credit scoring and affordability checks.\n\nYorkshire Building Society's new deal is not the first to offer a low deposit route into homeownership.\n\nSkipton Building Society made headlines last year when it launched a 100 per cent mortgage for renters to enable them to get onto the property ladder without a deposit.\n\nAverage savings: Analysts at Yorkshire BS thinks allowing a deposit of just \u00a35,000 would make a huge difference to first-time buyers by reducing the time it takes them to save up\n\nAnother product that allows first-time buyers to get on the ladder without a deposit is the Barclays Springboard mortgage, though this requires family and friends to help with the deposit.\n\nIn this case, the helper provides a 10 per cent deposit as security for five years and it's placed into a Helpful Start account that earns interest and is returned after five years.\n\nHowever, it is thought that there has been limited uptake for these types of products.\n\nNicholas Mendes, mortgage technical manager at broker, John Charcol, says: 'Those that would benefit from such a deal are likely to be high earners and prospective buyers with a good credit score that just simply haven't been able to save a deposit amid high rents.\n\nExpert view: Nicholas Mendes, mortgage technical manager at John Charcol thinks the new mortgage product could benefit high earners and those with good credit scores\n\n'That said, while it's encouraging to see lenders launch new products and expand their existing criteria, sometimes these don't always have the desired impact - especially when we consider comparable options in the market which help borrowers overcome affordability or deposit barriers.\n\n'For example, Skipton's track record mortgage, Barclays' springboard or even the recent Own New proposition all support the first-time buyer and home mover market with fewer caveats and in some cases cheaper rates.'\n\nBen Merritt, director of mortgages at Yorkshire Building Society said research by the mutual has showed that \u00a35,000 was the right amount of deposit for it to require for first-time buyers.\n\nIt said it would shorten the time needed for them to get mortgage-ready, no matter where they live in the country.\n\n'Our analysis showed a deposit of \u00a35,000 \u2013 compared to a typical 5 per cent \u2013 would make a huge difference to first-time buyers across the country by reducing the time it takes them to save up and achieve homeownership, from a maximum of 7.5 years (in London), to around 2.5 years,' he said.\n\n'While \u00a35,000 represents a 1 per cent deposit for those who need to borrow the maximum amount available, the key is that customers are still putting money into a deposit, they still have to demonstrate strong creditworthiness and pass an affordability assessment to be eligible for a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage.\n\n'We have a duty to encourage financial responsibility in anyone taking out a mortgage.'\n\nLast year Leeds Building Society reported there will be 426,000 fewer first-time buyers who make it on to the housing ladder over the next five years, when placed against the 40-year average of 340,000 first time buyer purchases a year.\n\nThis is due in part to rises in mortgage rates over the past couple of years.\n\nYorkshire's own research suggests that 38 per cent of first-time buyers now receive financial help from friends and family in order to get on the ladder.\n\n'It creates a level playing field for those who don't have financial support from their families to fall back on,' adds Ben Merritt.\n\n'Our research among first-time buyers showed that 78 per cent of people in this category feel homeownership is becoming an elite privilege, while 63 per cent saying the UK is in danger of becoming a nation of renters.\n\n'This is a situation we believe can't be allowed to continue. We hope this \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage will help first-time buyers overcome the deposit barrier as we believe this group deserve a chance of homeownership.'",

Nationwide followed suit.\n\nSCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK DAVID YOUR MORTGAGE QUESTION\n\nMortgage help: Our weekly Navigate the Mortgage Maze column sees broker David Hollingworth answering your questions\n\nBarclays are valuing a third application together with the original building plans. But we're not optimistic.\n\nThere are issues involving the impartiality of the building owners, selling agent, mortgage broker, surveyor, all of whom are generating fees leading to the same outcome. What are your thoughts? A.K.\n\nDavid Hollingworth replies: When applying for a mortgage many borrowers' primary concern will be whether they will be eligible and qualify for the amount they want to borrow.\n\nBut a lender needs to be sure the property is worth what the buyer is paying for it in case something goes wrong at a later date and the property needs to be repossessed to repay the mortgage amount.\n\n- When will interest rates fall? Forecasts on when base rate will go down\n\nThe lender will require the property to be independently valued, to confirm its worth and to ensure there's nothing to be concerned about in terms of the construction and condition of the property.\n\nWorth knowing...\n\nA basic valuation is for the lender's purposes only so it's a good idea for any buyer to organise their own more detailed survey, which will help highlight any potential issues.\n\nLenders will typically prefer property that will be straightforward to sell in the future.\n\nTherefore, the breadth of appeal that a property will have on the open market is also important.\n\nThe more unusual a property, the smaller the market might be and the fewer the number of potential buyers might be.\n\nThat could apply to something like a property above commercial premises, especially something like a takeaway that could affect the 'saleability' of the property.\n\nSome lenders place limits on the maximum number of floors in a block and take account of other factors including ex local authority, open deck access.\n\nSome lenders will prefer to judge each property on its own merits. There's also likely to be more flexibility on the maximum number of floors in areas where higher rise is more common - London being a prime example.\n\n> True Cost Mortgage Calculator: Check what a new fixed rate would cost\n\nLenders can have limits on the maximum number of floors in a block and take account of other factors including ex local authority, open deck access\n\nHowever, as your son and partner are finding there may be additional expectation that a property above a certain number of storeys should have a lift.\n\nThis could mean that a property of more than four storeys (ground plus three) would be expected to have a lift.\n\nNationwide can take exception to this rule, but its typical expectation would be for a flat in a block above four storeys to have a lift, whether the flat is on a higher floor or not.\n\nAccessibility is obviously important for any property and the higher the number of floors the more that a lack of lift will affect the ability to sell.\n\nSome lenders will have the ability to consider any property rather than have a rigid limit, but they will rely on the valuers comments and recommendation. Santander and Barclays would both fit into that bracket.\n\nUnfortunately, that means you are dependent on the valuer's comments and it's hard to know the likely outcome in advance.\n\nIt sounds like the purchase is from a housing association, so it would be worth discussing with them as well as local surveyors who know the property, as to how this issue was resolved in the past.\n\nThat may help give an idea of lenders that have accepted the property before, although as you've discovered it doesn't guarantee that the surveyor will take the same view as others in the past.\n\nIt is therefore possible that the Barclays application will fare differently and be successful.\n\nThere are a lot of different moving parts in the process but it's in the interest of all, from vendor to agent to adviser to enable the sale.\n\nYou could however consider seeking a second opinion if you continue to run into issues.\n\nIf it's still problematic, it's also worth considering that options could be limited for buyers in future, if your son and his partner want to sell.",

When complete, the project is tipped to be responsible for 101 tonnes of carbon reduction per year.\n\nThe works, delivered through the Non-Domestic Energy Efficiency Framework (NDEE), will replace the existing gas heating system with a new 640kW air source heat pump. An integral part of this is the existing secondary heating system upgrades which will be implemented alongside the heat pump.\n\nKieran Walsh, Vital Energi\u2019s operations manager (North & Scotland), explained, \u201cThis is an ambitious carbon reduction project opting for full heat decarbonisation in a single phase without any reliance on gas. By swapping fossil fuels for renewables, the college will take a considerable step towards their carbon targets and the project exemplifies how electrification of heat can be implemented efficiently with secondary system upgrades.\n\n\u201cEdinburgh College has a renowned engineering, renewables and energy efficiency training centre, which will play a key role in addressing the low-carbon sector\u2019s skills gap. We look forward to collaborating with the college to showcase an exemplary heat decarbonisation solution to their students who are the UK\u2019s future engineers.\u201d\n\nThe project comes with an energy performance contract, which guarantees certain key performance indicators, such as carbon reduction, will be met, giving the college the certainty the new heating system will perform as promised.\n\nColin Mclaren, Edinburgh College estates services manager, said, \u201cWe are excited to be working with Vital Energi to deliver this key project on the college\u2019s journey towards net zero. The funding provided through the Scottish Government\u2019s Energy Efficiency Grant Scheme has allowed us to fully implement decarbonisation at our Midlothian Campus, which is a pathfinder project for the sector.\u201d\n\nAudrey Cumberford, Edinburgh College principal, added, \u201cWe are delighted to be working alongside Vital Energi to deliver such an important project for our college. We have a huge responsibility as one of Scotland\u2019s largest colleges to lead from the front and play our part in addressing the climate emergency. This project is vital in reducing our carbon emissions and bringing us closer to our net zero goals.\u201d",

      "article_text": "Officials from the US Department of Homeland Security raided properties in Los Angeles and Miami owned by rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs earlier this week for undisclosed reasons.\n\nThe raids come after several lawsuits for sexual misconduct were filed against Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy and P Diddy, including one by singer Cassie, full name Casandra Ventura, with whom he was in a relationship for 10 years.\n\nVentura's multi-million dollar lawsuit was quickly settled out of court, and three more were filed by additional claimants with allegations of rape, sex trafficking and sexual abuse in the following days, causing a number of companies and brands to drop Diddy as an ambassador.\n\nDiddy, then known as Puffy Daddy, founded Bad Boy Records in 1993, and the label became the epicentre of rap and hip-hop in New York in the mid-1990s, signing and breaking artists such as the Notorious BIG, Mary J Blige and Usher.\n\nIn 1998, Diddy made his first venture into business outside of music, founding the Sean John clothing line that was stocked in major stores such as Macy's and at its peak reported retail sales of $450m.\n\nBusiness Bulletin\n\nDiddy was also an ambassador for Diageo-owned C\u00eeroc vodka and got paid by the case, an especially lucrative deal considering annual sales of the brand grew from 75,000 to 2.6m between 2007 to 2014 when he founded Combs Wines and Spirits.\n\nCombs Wines and Spirits and Diageo later jointly owned DeLeon Tequilla. The drinks group ended its partnership with Diddy last year over unfulfilled commitments, but not before he had earned hundreds of millions of dollars from the deal.\n\nDiddy's other investments include the Revolt TV cable network and alkaline water company Aquahydrate with actor Mark Wahlberg, and his Los Angeles and Miami property portfolios are reported to be worth more than $80m combined.\n\nBy 2022, Combs' net worth had grown to an estimated $1bn, according to Forbes, although it has likely fallen over the past year after giving up the publishing rights for Bad Boy's artists and the end of the Diageo deal. Celebrity Net Worth claims he is now worth $800m.\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami were raided by US law enforcement on Monday. (Pic: Lexie Moreland/WWD via Getty Images)\n\nDiddy's pre-tax earnings from Bad Boy, C\u00eeroc, Sean John and his other investments are believed to be in excess of $1bn.\n\nIn Ventura's lawsuit against Combs, her attorney described him as \"immensely powerful, and immensely dangerous,\" and accused him of using \"his money and power to orchestrate extensive efforts to hide the evidence of his abuse.\n\nPhoto: Sean 'Diddy' Combs.

The Hub is a liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal being developed in Stade, northern Germany.\n\nThis project is strategically important to Germany and the Czech Republic as it will ensure the ongoing security and resilience of their energy supply. Output from the terminal will be sufficient to meet a significant portion of the countries\u2019 annual gas consumption requirements. The terminal development is designed to recycle waste heat from adjacent industrial plants, which eliminates the need for any additional heat source in the regasification process. The project will also be ready to handle biomethane and synthetic natural gas from the time of commissioning, and in future could be adapted to handle hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia. The terminal will begin operating in 2027. Standard Chartered played a leading role in the syndication of banks financing the project.

      "article_text": "Justin Sun, the founder of the TRON blockchain platform, has established a name as one of the most influential, most controversial, and wealthiest faces of the cryptocurrency world. The reputation is by no means without merit, as Justin Sun\u2019s involvement with cryptocurrency brought him enormous wealth, a substantial amount of which he keeps in cryptocurrency. But just how much really is Justin Sun\u2019s net worth today?\n\nJustin Sun and TRON\n\nJustin Sun has a long history with cryptocurrency, the driving force behind his substantial wealth, which started in 2017 when he founded TRON.\n\nTRON is a decentralized blockchain operating system that relies on smart contracts, delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), and its native crypto token, Tronix ( is a decentralized blockchain operating system that relies on smart contracts, delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), and its native crypto token, TRX ). Initially an ERC-20 token based on Ethereum, it established its blockchain in 2018. It aims to allow direct interactions and transactions without intermediaries for content creators and decentralized applications (DApps) users.\n\nRecommended video: Tron explained in 60 seconds\n\nSource: The Crypto Archives YouTube\n\nIn 2017, The TRON Foundation raised approximately $70 million through an initial coin offering (ICO) just before China banned the digital tokens. Justin Sun was aware of the imminent ban and pushed for the ICO before the ban could be announced. Shortly after, he left the country and moved to the United States.\n\nFun fact: Sun was named the most noteworthy new entrepreneur by China Network Television (CNTV) in 2015 and made it into Forbes\u2018 30 Under 30 Asia list from 2015 to 217.\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s other business endeavors\n\nIn addition to his crypto roots in TRON, Justin Sun\u2019s portfolio contains additional projects, stock holdings, and crypto components.\n\nIn June 2018, he acquired BitTorrent (later rebranded as Rainberry Inc.) for $140 million. The company is known for developing the eponymous and popular peer-to-peer file transferring and communication protocol.\n\nSun has also acquired the crypto exchange Poloniex, which was subsequently marred in controversy regarding recurring security breaches, including the most recent $120 million theft by hackers in November 2023.\n\nIn October 2021, Sun participated in the $65 million funding round in Animoca, the software company behind crypto and blockchain games like The Sandbox. He has also spent more than $100 million on behalf of NFT projects and funds for artworks by Picasso, Warhol, Pak, and Giacometti. In March 2024, he provided $480 million for the Ether.Fi protocol.\n\nFun fact: Between 2021 and 2023, the founder of TRON acted as the ambassador and Permanent Representative of Grenada to the WTO. He reportedly leveraged the role to advocate for the greater embracement of cryptocurrency.\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s crypto portfolio\n\nThe bulk of Justin Sun\u2019s publicly known net worth comes from his cryptocurrency portfolio. This portfolio\u2019s history goes back to TRON\u2019s initial ICO in 2017, but the crypto investor has since amassed many other tokens.\n\nAs of March 27, 2024, according to Arkham Intelligence\u2019s profile, Justin Sun\u2019s crypto portfolio contains assets worth about $1.18 billion. Unlike Vitalik Buterin, who derives his net worth almost entirely from Ether (ETH), Sun\u2019s crypto wallet content is more diversified.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, its largest component is not TRX but USDD, the stablecoin he launched that is pegged to the U.S. dollar, and Sun holds 280 million USDD tokens, worth approximately $278.34 million.\n\nNext comes a substantial pile of 2.131 billion TRX tokens worth about $257.13 million.\n\nIn third place is BitTorrent (BTT), with almost 102 trillion tokens worth $157.93 million. This is followed by 1443 Bitcoins (BTC), currently valued at $101 million, and 84 million JUST Stablecoin tokens (USDJ) worth $94.55 million. Other significant components in Sun\u2019s crypto portfolio include STETH, STUSDT, WTRX, USDT, AETHUSDT, SHIB, and NFT, among others.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that $0.97 billion of this crypto portfolio traces back to the TRON chain, meaning 80% of his known crypto worth is directly tied to the performance of his blockchain platform.\n\nAll the above said, Arkham Intelligence claims it is highly likely that Justin Sun has additional crypto wallets beyond the publicly claimed one analyzed above due to the patterns of TRX transactions between 2020 and 2022.\n\nFun fact: The profile image on Justin Sun\u2019s : The profile image on Justin Sun\u2019s X (formerly Twitter) account is an NFT, for which he paid $15 million.\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s X profile image. Source: x.com\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s non-crypto holdings\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, Sun has significant stakes in crypto-related businesses like BitTorrent and Poloniex. Furthermore, he was an early investor in Animoca Brands, which was valued at 5.9 million in 2022.\n\nHe also purchased valuable art pieces for the purpose of turning them into NFT tokens:\n\nLe Nez by Alberto Giacometti \u2013 $78.4 million\n\nFemme nue couch\u00e9e au collier by Pablo Picasso \u2013 $20 million\n\nThree self-portraits by Andy Warhol \u2013 $1.5 million\n\nSun also reportedly spread $12 million across GameStop (NYSE: GME), AMC (NYSE: AMC), and silver during the meme-stock period, but his current positions on these stocks and commodities remain unknown.\n\nThat said, the mentioned stakes and commodities remain private investments and therefore how much exactly they contribute to his total net worth cannot be reliably verified.\n\nWho is Justin Sun?\n\nBorn in Xining, China, in 1990, the Chinese entrepreneur, businessman, and diplomat holds a BA in history from Peking University and an MA in East Asian studies from the University of Pennsylvania. He made his first crypto investment while studying in Philadelphia.\n\nJustin Sun, the founder of TRON\n\nSun gained attention (and notoriety) for risky moves (such as TRON\u2019s ICO amid China\u2019s ban), aggressive marketing, and controversial financial strategies. He remains a polarizing figure in the crypto community as he maintains an active social media presence and continues to initiate debates centered around ethics, business practice, and professionalism in the blockchain industry.\n\nIn 2019, Justin Sun made headlines with a record $4.57 million bid for a charity dinner with Warren Buffett, marking the highest bid in the auction\u2019s history. Aimed at discussing blockchain\u2019s potential, the dinner, delayed due to Sun\u2019s health and regulatory concerns, occurred in January 2020 in Omaha, Nebraska, with other crypto and blockchain leaders attending.\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s net worth: the bottom line\n\nThe publicly available information on Justin Sun\u2019s reported cryptocurrency wallet is enough to make the TRON inventor a billionaire, as it contains about $1.18 billion in value as of March 27, 2024, and more than 80% of the sum is bound to his TRON blockchain,\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Sun also has significant value in stock holdings in BitTorrent and Poloniex (potentially also other businesses, like Animoca Brands), NFT, artwork, and any assets not disclosed to the broader public. When coupled with the suspicion that he owns additional crypto wallets, Justin Sun\u2019s actual net worth could go even higher.\n\nEven as it appears, Justin Sun\u2019s net worth makes him a crypto billionaire, which gives merit to his crypto advocacy and desire to bring wider recognition to digital currency worldwide.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

      "article_text": "March has, arguably, been the most interesting month so far of a year, generally highly exciting for the crypto market.\n\nThe third month featured a frenzied rally that saw Bitcoin (BTC) propelled to a new all-time high near $73,000 and saw the emergence of multiple fresh meme coin millionaires.\n\nMore recently, however, an unexpected correction saw a massive decline in the value of many cryptocurrencies \u2013 followed by a renewed but cautious rally as April, the month of the BTC halving, approaches.\n\nTerra Classic (LUNC) proved just as susceptible to the current market trends as any other coin or token and had a major rally in early March, a significant drop toward the middle of the month, and restarted its rise since.\n\nGoogle Gemini predicts Terra Classic price for December\n\nWith all the crypto market excitement and Terra Classic activity of 2024, Finbold first consulted Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) own artificial intelligence (AI) model \u2013 Google Gemini \u2013 on how the cryptocurrency might fare by the end of the year,\n\nGemini\u2019s initial forecast could best be described as cautious as it set its sights at a December price of $0.0002 \u2013 almost exactly at the current 2024 highs for the token.\n\nGemini sets LUNC price target for December. Source: Finbold and Google Gemini\n\nThe AI reasoned that, despite the current trends in the crypto market, a massive bull run later in the year is not guaranteed, and that, even should one take place, LUNC faces an uphill battle due to its damaged reputation.\n\nWhen asked to provide a prediction with more decimals to offer greater utility for its forecast, Gemini\u2019s revision proved bearish as it set its new target at $0.000185.\n\nGoogle Gemini provides a more precise target for LUNC for December. Source: Finbold and Google Gemini\n\nThe large language model (LLM) reiterated its previous reasoning but added that the altered forecast is made to reflect more strongly the headwinds likely to be faced by LUNC, but also account for the likely upside given the Terra Classic team\u2019s efforts to revitalize the token and its ecosystem.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot predicts Terra Classic price for December\n\nNot to settle for a single source, Finbold also consulted Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Copilot on its own prediction for LUNC.\n\nCopilot \u2013 specifically its creative \u201cvoice\u201d \u2013 proved more bullish on Terra Classic than Gemini and set its sights on $0.0003 in December.\n\nMicrosoft AI\u2019s reasoning was relatively similar to its counterpart\u2019s citing the current crypto market trends, but it also focused on the competition and adversity LUNC is facing.\n\nIts revision, however, proved more bullish as Copilot placed its more precise forecast at $0.000327, though its supplemental reasoning proved more generic, generally citing the influence of broad market trends on individual cryptocurrencies and the potential impact of technological developments or regulatory actions.\n\nCopilot sets the price target for LUNC for December. Source: Finbold and Copilot\n\nLUNC price chart\n\nWhatever December 2024 may bring for Terra Classic, the first quarter of the year proved highly volatile for the token as it is, after several major ups and downs in recent months, a total of 12.14% in the green since January 1.\n\nLUNC 1-year price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMore recent trading, however, proved significantly more bullish as LUNC is up 18.68% in the last 30 days, and 18.73% on the weekly chart.

In addition, clear guidance, support, and the timely laying of regulations in 2024 will be essential for giving the sector clarity on the changes it needs to make, and by when.\u201d",

At that point, the \u00a320,000 limit that investors are can invest up to each year will reset.\n\nMany investors tend to rush into buying stocks around this time for fear of missing out on potential tax-free gains. While I\u2019d never advocate that, I\u2019ve had my eye on these two for a while. If I have the spare cash, I hope to pick them up over the coming days.\n\nPlease note that tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances of each client and may be subject to change in future. The content in this article is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to be, neither does it constitute, any form of tax advice.\n\nUnilever\n\nThe first of these is Unilever (LSE: ULVR). The stock has got off to a strong start this year. But it\u2019s still down 6.6% in the last 12 months, so I see an opportunity.\n\nThere are a few reasons I like the business, including its recent decision to spin off its ice cream division. It announced a plan earlier this month, which will see the company cut 7,500 jobs in a bid to save \u00a3684m over the next three years. This feeds more widely into the firm\u2019s Growth Action Plan.\n\nI think this is a smart play. Running its ice cream division is capital-intensive. Through streamlining, the business will be able to focus on its stronger assets. This is something that many shareholders have been hoping the business will do for years.\n\nSteps such as these should help Unilever grow earnings in the times ahead and, as a result, grow its dividend too. Right now, it yields 3.8%. That\u2019s in line with the FTSE 100 average and has seen steady growth over the last decade.\n\nUnilever faces a few challenges. Inflation is an ongoing risk that has forced the firm to increase its prices. This could see consumers switch to cheaper alternatives. Its restructuring plans inevitably may further pose challenges.\n\nHowever, I like its defensive nature. It sells essential products that are used by 3.4bn people every day. It\u2019s such companies that I want to own.\n\nGames Workshop\n\nI\u2019m also looking to increase my holdings in Games Workshop (LSE: GAW). In the past five years, the stock has surged. I think it can keep performing going forward.\n\nLike Unilever, it offers a passive income opportunity through its 4.3% yield. However, that\u2019s not the reason I want to buy more shares.\n\nThe main factor for me is its dominant market position. It\u2019s the frontrunner in the tabletop wargaming industry and right now has little competition. Looking back at its impressive revenue growth in the last decade is evidence of how beneficial this has been for the firm.\n\nThe business attracts millions of players and many of its boxsets are sold out within just a few days of being released. Nevertheless, the firm has no plans to slow down. It\u2019s now broadening its horizons as it vies to turn its Warhammer universe into film and TV content.\n\nOf course, with the UK in a \u2018technical recession\u2019, there\u2019s the threat that sales will slow in the times ahead. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s trading on a high 23 times trailing earnings.\n\nHowever, with its loyal customer base and ambitious plans, I\u2019m bullish on Games Workshop.",

      "article_text": "UK \u2013 User experience (UX) specialists and market researchers have many overlapping skills and there needs to be more awareness of UX in the wider research industry, a panel told the recent Market Research Society CX/UX/MR conference.\n\nSpeaking on at the event, Greg Alexander, senior UX researcher at MusicMagpie, said that there are striking similarities between the two disciplines.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a massive amount of overlap,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are specialist areas that can put people off a bit. But they\u2019re the skills you can teach most people.\n\n\u201cThe basic skills of being a UX researcher are near identical, if not completely the same, to being a market researcher \u2013 it\u2019s about communication, empathy, stakeholder management and understanding what clients want and what customers are telling you. At its core, you are trying to achieve the same thing.\u201d\n\nAlexander said that his role often saw him tackle market research problems despite being principally a UX researcher, and that market research skills were useful to have in his main role.\n\n\u201cA lot of research I do now blends UX and market research,\u201d he explained. \u201cMost of the time they are really interlinked \u2013 I look at what people are doing online, how they use the website, testing different designs, but fundamentally that is revealing something about your customer, and about their needs, behaviour and who they are.\n\n\u201cYou might have to reframe it slightly and you may have to pose it in a different way, but what you are finding out and learning is almost identical.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Alexander said, both disciplines faced a battle to be heard within major companies. \u201cThere\u2019s often a big gap between how far companies say they value research, whether UX or market research, and how much they use it.\u201d\n\nKatie Utley, lead UX researcher at Sky Betting & Gaming, said that while some core technologies are specialised to UX, many of the same techniques are used in market research. \u201cThis is market research \u2013 it\u2019s just a small part of it,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, she said there was a lack of knowledge in the industry about the role UX plays. \u201cEven in the market research world, I get people who come up to me and ask \u2018what do you do\u2019,\u201d Utley added. \u201cIt is the same as what you are doing, except I am looking at the product whereas you\u2019re looking at everything and everyone from a market perspective.\u201d\n\nUtley added she was optimistic about the future: \u201cUX is becoming more and more listened to. Which is nice, and you see the results of your research being put into actual customer hands.\u201d\n\nMelissa Hamdoun, senior market researcher at Blinkist, had a perspective as a market researcher adjusting to being in a more UX-focused team, adding that her team had no market research or qual researcher function before she started in her role.\n\n\u201cWhen I came in, there was some apprehension about whether the two would work together and merge together,\u201d Hamdoun added. \u201cI think we were treating it as a qual/quant relationship, but I think UX researchers are becoming more like a market researcher, and I am becoming more of a UX researcher, and we are meeting in the middle.\u201d\n\nShe added that clients often needed educating on when to use UX and when to use market research, and said a key skill is understanding where the different techniques from one discipline could assist in a project driven by the other.\n\n\u201cYou have to find a balance between the best in class of market research and you can skim that down without losing the value of it, but make it more relevant within the product environment we\u2019re working with,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe stakeholder can get on board because it is closer to the UX they are familiar with.\u201d",

      "article_text": "The prime minister Rishi Sunak has defended the pace of system-wide reform for councils with high dedicated schools grant deficits.\n\nLast week four councils joined the Department for Education's safety valve programme.\n\nDuring the liaison committee hearing yesterday, the education committee chair Robin Walker (Con) asked if the prime minister can \u201caddress\u201d the high needs budgets for councils that \u201cthat seem to be getting larger and larger over the years without actually reducing or removing those deficits\u201d despite councils being part of the safety valve and delivering better value programmes.\n\nThese initiatives were launched by the Department for Education (DfE) to help local authorities tackle overspending on special educational needs and disabilities services for young people and children since 2022-23.\n\nUnder the safety valve programme, the DfE agrees to pay additional funding through the dedicated schools grant (DSG) if councils reform their high-needs provision and reduce their deficit.\n\nIn response to Mr Walker's question, Mr Sunak said that he \u201cappreciates that the safety valve schemes are for the immediate relief\u201d but the government\u2019s \u2018change\u2019 programme is being trialled with nine different partnerships in \u201cabout 30 different local areas\u201d.\n\nSunak said it is \u201cimportant that we test those interventions at that level before rolling them out in a system-wide basis\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cPeople might have debates about the pace but given the importance of getting the reforms right to alleviate the longer-term pressure, it is right we trial those first\u201d.\n\nMr Walker also asked a similar question during the Commons' education committee session on the rising cost of children's social care and its impact on councils yesterday.\n\nHe asked: \u201cWe see in the special educational needs and disabilities space the government investing in programmes with safety valve and delivering better value helping them to manage those deficits but we don\u2019t see them turning them around or in very few cases. What would turn things around?\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s services spokesperson for the County Councils Network, Roger Gough (Con) said it is a \u201ccommon experience of local authorities\u201d to be under too much immediate pressure to make choices that will improve their position in the longer term.\n\nMr Gough is also the leader of Kent CC that has a safety valve agreement of an additional \u00a3142m in its dedicated schools grant for the financial years from 2022-23 until 2027-28.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou find yourself on the treadmill, where the more urgent areas eat up an increasing proportion of your resource and it becomes ever harder to do the things that will help you out further down the line.\u201d\n\nLast week, a further four councils had plans to reduce their high-need deficits as part of the safety valve programme accepted by the Department for Education while five councils areas had their payments suspended.\n\nBristol City Council, Devon CC, Wiltshire and Bracknell Forest Councils have been accepted on the government\u2019s safety valve programme for the upcoming financial year.\n\nThe DfE has agreed to pay Devon CC \u00a395m in additional DSG payments from 2023-24 until 2031-32 to help it get rid of its deficit.\n\nWiltshire will receive \u00a367m until 2028-29 and Bristol will get an extra \u00a353.8m and Bracknell Forest \u00a316m until 2029-30.\n\nWhile the previous agreements with Bath and North East Somerset Council, Dorset Council Cambridgeshire CC, Hillingdon LBC and Norfolk CC have been put on hold until \u201crevised agreement is reached\u201d.\n\nThese agreements are \u201cunder review\u201d due to \u201cinsufficient progress\u201d being made on their plan to reduce their in-year balance on its DSG account, changes to the national SEND policy and differing DSG formula funding levels than originally \u201cassumed\u201d.\n\nApplications for additional capital funding and the success of bids for special free schools are also being assessed by the DfE over the \u201cimpact of the change in circumstances\u201d.",

      "article_text": "In the last ten years, the UK\u2019s rental market has witnessed a dramatic upsurge in prices, highlighting the intense demand and supply imbalance faced by tenants and landlords alike. Research conducted by Zero Deposit paints a stark picture of the rental landscape, where costs have surged and the availability of rental property has dwindled.\n\nThe Climbing Ladder of Rental Costs\n\nZero Deposit\u2019s analysis of the rental market data reveals an alarming trend: the average rent in the UK has increased by 46% over the past decade. Sam Reynolds, CEO of Zero Deposit, notes, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that our reliance on the rental market has been growing consistently over the last decade, however, demand for rental homes has exploded in recent years as soaring house prices have forced many to postpone their plans to purchase.\u201d This surge is attributed to a significant rise in demand, which has not been matched by an adequate supply of rental properties.\n\nThe Deposits Dilemma\n\nInterestingly, while the Tenant Fees Act 2019 sought to alleviate some financial pressures on tenants by capping the rental deposit, the relief was short-lived. For the first time since the act\u2019s introduction, the average cost of a rental deposit has increased, marking a 3.1% rise in 2023. This change reflects the growing financial challenges renters face, with the total value of tenancy deposits held skyrocketing to \u00a35.15 billion in 2023, a 73% increase from 2014.\n\nA Market Under Strain\n\nThe statistics offer a bleak outlook for the UK\u2019s rental sector, with over 5 million deposits currently held, representing a 66% increase from a decade ago. The availability of rental homes has seen a decline, with a 0.3% annual reduction noted in 2023, further exacerbating the issue of scarce supply against surging demand. Reynolds adds, \u201cWe simply don\u2019t have an adequate supply of quality rental accommodation to satisfy this surge in demand and the consequence of this market imbalance has been a huge acceleration in the cost of renting.\u201d\n\nThe situation paints a picture of a rental market under significant strain, with costs spiraling out of control and tenants facing increasingly insurmountable financial hurdles. The narrative underscores the urgent need for policy interventions and market adjustments to address the growing disparity between supply and demand in the UK\u2019s property sector.",

It expects to question consumer, professional and industry bodies, and conclude with questions to the Department for Levelling Up, Communities, and the housing minister.\n\nAreas covered by the inquiry include:\n\nHow efficient or effective is the existing process for buying and selling homes? How could this be improved?\n\nWhat is the impact of issues in the transaction process, such as gazumping or gazundering, and how could they be remedied?\n\nDo buyers have the right information available at the right time during transactions?\n\nDo consumers have sufficient information to determine which conveyancer to use? How could information provision on conveyancing be improved?\n\nThe committee will accept written evidence covering its terms of reference until 18 April.\n\nLevelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee chair Clive Betts says: \u201cThe process of buying and selling a home in England is often stressful for those involved.\n\n\u201cIndeed, despite there being around two million households who successfully buy or sell their home each year, consumers often find the process is not as efficient, effective, or as consumer-friendly as it could be.\n\n\u201cAs part of this inquiry, we will look at the chief obstacles to improving the process of buying and selling a home.\n\n\u201cWe will be keen to examine issues such as the time taken to complete a transaction and challenges in finding the right information.\n\n\u201cTopics such as a lack of transparency around conveyancing services, the payment of \u2018referral fees\u2019, and the weak regulation of estate agents will also be on our agenda in this inquiry\u201d.",
      "article_summary": "Parliament\u2019s Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee has launched an inquiry into improving homebuying and selling in England.\nThe cross-party group of MPs will examine the transaction process, information available to buyers, and the role of conveyancers and estate agents.\nWhat is the impact of issues in the transaction process, such as gazumping or gazundering, and how could they be remedied?\nDo buyers have the right information available at the right time during transactions?\n\u201cWe will be keen to examine issues such as the time taken to complete a transaction and challenges in finding the right information.",

      "article_text": "Deceased account manager Phillips & Cohen Associates (PCA) has launched a bespoke service for banks and building societies when looking to resolve mortgage probate matters.\n\nPCA says that currently, when a borrower dies, the mortgage provider has a limited insight into the household circumstances and that can inadvertently lead to outcomes which are less than satisfactory.\n\nWhere amicable resolution cannot be achieved, lenders can be forced to exercise their rights to repossess the property if they perceive their loan to be at risk, PCA says. More often they continue to take payments without a new contractual relationship being in place while they provide extended forbearance to allow the deceased\u2019s family members time to sell, or re-mortgage.\n\nAligning with the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s new Consumer Duty obligations, PCA\u2019s new Probate Mortgage Resolution Service takes the time-consuming task of resolving the issue away from the lender.\n\nIt means that cases which previously may have taken years to resolve, or in extreme circumstances could have resulted in a home being repossessed, can now be resolved amicably producing better outcomes for all concerned PCA says.\n\nThe firm claims that in trials with a major national mortgage provider over the last two years, PCA\u2019s Mortgage Resolution Service was able to resolve 93% of all referred cases, 60% of them within 12 months.\n\nPCA chief operating officer Nick Cherry says that banks want to do the right thing by their customers, but often don\u2019t know where to start: \u201cMost have an initial period of forbearance where they try and resolve the situation themselves,\u201d he explains, \u201cand sometimes they are successful. But in many cases they hit a roadblock.\n\n\u201cBased on our experience, we believe there are at least \u00a325m per month of mortgage accounts sat in this unresolved status beyond the lender\u2019s initial forbearance period \u2013 that\u2019s at least \u00a3300m per year where we believe our new product could add significant value. And the numbers could be higher.\u201d\n\n\u201cMortgage lenders invest heavily in long-term relationships with the customers and our Mortgage Resolution Service is an extension of that support when families need it most. Bereavement is a difficult time for families, and there are many cases where a home, which is mortgaged by the deceased, is still being lived in by a relative or beneficiary and the mortgage payments continue to be paid. The challenge for the mortgage provider is in their obligation to deliver good outcomes to their customers without knowing who the \u2018real customer\u2019 is after the mortgage holder has died.\n\n\u201cWe help facilitate those good outcomes, reaching out to the executors with a speedy resolution that wherever possible keeps a loved one in their home with a new mortgage from the lender that is set up with consideration of their own particular circumstances.\u201d",

The company's workforce remained steady in the period, with 714 people employed at the firm last year, with staff wages and salaries in the period totalling \u20ac33.8m.\n\nThe company's total administrative expenses rose by almost \u20ac10m, increasing to \u20ac40.1m in 2023.\n\nFounded in 1985 by Paul Hourican, PFH was acquired last year by Japanese imaging company, Ricoh for an undisclosed amount. The purchase saw Mr Hourican step down from his role as chairman, with the former founder since taking on an executive chairman role at supermarket supply chain firm, Kwayga.\n\nLast year also saw two other directors resign in a post-acquisition switch-up, with four new directors being appointed in 2023.\n\nThe IT firm's pre-tax profit fell by more than two-thirds, dropping to 5.1m from \u20ac15.7m in the previous year. The company paid a dividend of \u20ac18.2m last year, up significantly from \u20ac7.4m in 2022.\n\nLooking forward, the company said it will continue to identify additional IT-related solutions and expand its range of supports provide to customers.",

      "article_text": "The DOE selected 20 states for the deployment of up to $6 billion in funding to reduce emissions from energy-intensive manufacturing industries.\n\nThe United States Department of Energy (DOE) has selected 20 states for the deployment of up to $6 billion in funding to reduce emissions from energy-intensive manufacturing industries, which it said is the highest investment in industrial decarbonization in the country.\n\nBankrolled by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the amount will go to 33 projects that \u201cwill create and maintain tens of thousands of high-quality jobs and help accelerate the commercial-scale demonstration of emerging industrial decarbonization technologies crucial to meeting the Biden-Harris Administration's climate and domestic manufacturing goals\u201d, the DOE said in a news release.\n\n\u201cThe projects will focus on the highest emitting industries where decarbonization technologies will have the greatest impact, including aluminum and other metals, cement and concrete, chemicals and refining, iron and steel, and more\u201d.\n\nThe projects, which still must engage in negotiations with the DOE to finalize their allotments, are estimated to result in emission reductions of 14 million metric tons of carbon dioxide yearly, the equivalent of annual emissions from three million gasoline-run cars, according to the department.\n\n\u201cFunded projects will cut carbon emissions by an average of 77 percent\u201d, the DOE said. \u201cThe industrial sector\u2019s unique and complex decarbonization challenges require equally unique and innovative decarbonization solutions that leverage multiple pathways including energy efficiency, electrification, and alternative fuels and feedstocks such as clean hydrogen\u201d.\n\nNearly one-third of the country\u2019s overall greenhouse gas emissions come from the industrial sector, the DOE said.\n\nSeven projects have been picked in the chemicals and refining sector \u201cto demonstrate opportunities to upcycle captured carbon to value-added products, create high-quality fuels and materials from recycled products, and replace fossil-fired, high-heat processes with decarbonized fuels\u201d, the announcement said. \u201cTogether, the seven projects would create products like clean fuels for the marine sector, electrolytes for electric vehicle batteries, and high-quality plastics\u201d.\n\nAmong the selectees in this sector is Exxon Mobil Corp., which has been allocated a provisional $331.9 million for its Baytown Olefins Plant Carbon Reduction Project in Texas. At the project, the oil and gas giant plans to use hydrogen in place of natural gas to produce ethylene, a chemical feedstock used to produce plastic resins, synthetic rubber and textiles.\n\nThe other sectors covered by the funding are aluminum and metals; iron and steel; cement and concrete; glass; pulp and paper; process heat; and food and beverage.\n\nThe developers of the 33 projects expect to shell out about $14 billion for their part of the expenses, according to the DOE press release.\n\n\u201cSpurring on the next generation of decarbonization technologies in key industries like steel, paper, concrete, and glass will keep America the most competitive nation on Earth\u201d, Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm said in a statement. \u201cThanks to President Biden\u2019s industrial strategy, DOE is making the largest investment in industrial decarbonization in the history of the United States. These investments will slash emissions from these difficult-to-decarbonize sectors and ensure American businesses and American workers remain at the forefront of the global economy\u201d.\n\nIn line with the Biden administration\u2019s Justice40 Initiative, nearly 80 percent of the projects are in disadvantaged communities, the DOE said. Justice40, which President Joe Biden passed January 27, 2021, through an executive order, targets to direct 40 percent of the benefits of certain investments, including those poured into clean energy and housing, to disadvantaged communities.\n\n\u201cAs part of the Administration\u2019s commitments to invest in America\u2019s workforce, support high-quality American jobs, advance environmental and energy justice, and strengthen tribal energy sovereignty, each project was required to develop and ultimately implement a comprehensive Community Benefits Plan\u2014which will be informed by early and meaningful community and labor engagements in each region\u201d, the DOE said.\n\n\u201cApplicants were required to describe how their proposals would provide the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people in a facility\u2019s location, recognizing the opportunity this funding provides to address pollution for those disproportionately affected by industrial sector emissions and begin remediating existing social, economic, and health burdens\u201d.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

The highest figure in the data came in November 2023, at 13.319 million barrels per day. In December 2023, U.S. field production of crude oil came in at 13.315 million barrels per day, the data revealed.\n\nIn its latest short term energy outlook (STEO), which was released earlier this month, the EIA projected that U.S. crude oil production will average 12.91 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2024, 13.13 million barrels per day in the second quarter, 13.25 million barrels per day in the third quarter, 13.47 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter, and 13.19 million barrels per day overall in 2024.\n\nThe EIA forecast in the STEO that U.S. crude oil production will average 13.49 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2025, 13.66 million barrels per day in the second quarter, 13.68 million barrels per day in the third quarter, 13.78 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter, and 13.65 million barrels per day overall in 2025.\n\nAccording to its latest STEO, U.S. crude oil output averaged 13.28 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of last year and 12.93 million barrels per day overall in 2023. The EIA\u2019s previous February STEO projected that U.S. crude oil output would come in at 13.10 million barrels per day overall in 2024 and 13.49 million barrels per day overall in 2025.\n\nTo contact the author, email andreas.exarheas@rigzone.com",

After years of promises for growth, and having fallen into a technical recession in January, 2024 looks set to be another unstable year.\n\n24% of respondents to our survey named the economy as the most likely factor to impact their business confidence. This made it their top concern, overall.\n\nThe uncertainty is hitting SMEs hard. Many business owners have been forced to shift their focus from growth to simply maintaining cash flow. This translates into tough choices \u2013 40% reported cutting costs by streamlining operations, while 36% opted to raise prices in response to anticipated lower consumer spending.\n\nThese measures, while necessary in the short term, can hinder long-term growth prospects. Striking a balance between weathering the economic storm and investing in the future will be a key challenge for UK SMEs in 2024.\n\nEffect on mental health\n\nThe rising cost of living means customers are spending less, while fuel costs, business rates, and employee wages rise. That means entrepreneurs are being attacked on two fronts, with both their company\u2019s profits and personal income being sunk.\n\nFinancial worries appear to be a major cause of stress amongst small business owners. Companies that self-report as being in survival mode show a 7% increase in poor mental health.\n\nAreas with the slowest regional growth show the biggest spikes in bad mental health. In the North East, where the local economy is projected to grow by just 1.5% this year, more than one in five business owners described their mental well-being as poor.\n\nIn comparison, businesses based in Greater London (forecast to grow by 2%) reported a robust score of 62% for good mental health.\n\nCustomer demand\n\nConsumer appetite can slim or grow depending on many factors, like competitor offerings or market trends. This year, one cause casts a long shadow: the cost of living crisis.\n\nBuilding a strong customer base with consistent sales volume is crucial for companies trying to navigate today\u2019s choppy financial waters. But, spiralling inflation has squeezed household budgets, tightening the general public\u2019s purse and silencing SME cash tills.\n\nThis challenge isn't theoretical. 15% of UK organisations identified \u201cfluctuations in customer demand\u201d as their top concern for the year, surpassing even \u201caccess to funding.\u201d\n\nAcross every sector, competition is fierce as businesses fight for what little market share remains. This shift in priorities underscores the critical role customer profitability plays in maintaining healthy cash flow for SMEs.\n\nWhen we asked the best-performing firms in our survey what led to them \u201cthriving\u201d in 2023, 54% of respondents said strong customer relationships.\n\nIndustry impact\n\nAs UK consumers cut back on spending, \u2018unessential\u2019 industries are the first to suffer \u2013 one example being leisure firms. Bowling alleys or holiday parks are most concerned about volatile spending. 57% of leisure companies said this was their biggest challenge for 2024.\n\nFintechs were more confident. As households become more aware of their spending habits, many are relying on accountants or budgeting apps to save money. Because of this heightened demand, only 7% of financial firms said demand fluctuations were a concern.\n\nFunding and finance\n\nRaising money is never far away when it comes to SME challenges. Access to early-stage capital is essential to get a new business off the ground. Steep initial starting up costs mean it can take years for a company to become profitable.\n\nUnfortunately, UK funding has dried up. Venture capital funding of startups plunged by more than 50% last year as funds turned off their money taps. Tellingly, one in ten firms told Startups that access to capital was their main concern for the next 12 months.\n\nDespite the troubling outlook for funding next year, 63% of companies told us they will look to fundraise this year, versus just 14% who will not not.\n\nMany businesses have also built a back-up plan, however. Some 24% of respondents told us their main priority for 2024 was to diversify revenue streams \u2013 perhaps as a response to unstable customer demand \u2013 in an attempt to chase a more consistent and reliable source of income.\n\nNew technology\n\nNew tools and resources can help businesses to unlock greater efficiency by streamlining workflows and improving communication. However, this long-term vision comes with a hefty price tag attached, creating a Catch-22 situation for SMEs with limited budgets.\n\nThe challenge doesn't stop at finances. The digital skills gap presents another barrier to tech adoption. 11% of respondents identified a need for increased knowledge about digitalisation to fully leverage its benefits.\n\nThis highlights a critical area for learning and development (L&D) within SMEs, as upskilling the workforce becomes crucial for successful tech integration.\n\nInterestingly, the impact of this challenge isn't limited to specific sectors. While unsurprisingly topping the list for software firms (24%) and fintechs (11%), technological advancement also poses a significant concern for traditional industries.\n\nEven in hospitality and the creative arts, where 30% of firms say innovation is a key contributor to success, navigating the technological landscape was cited as a hurdle.\n\nAI disruption\n\nThe big business story of 2023 was the rise of ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence platforms in the workplace. This largely unregulated industry has quickly seeped into almost every sector of the UK business landscape. We found that 61% of UK firms think AI will disrupt their industry in 2024.\n\nOrganisations have quickly been forced to adapt to the new technology and its impact on office communication, supply chains, and customer service. It\u2019s a paradigm shift that shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nHowever, the business outlook around AI is positive. Our data shows that the more disruption expected, the more optimistic firms feel about the future. Just 2% of firms who expect a high level of AI disruption feel pessimistic about future growth, compared to 32% who anticipate no disruption.\n\nHowever, reaping the benefits of this new technology will require heavy investment from small firms into both the software and upskilling of employees to use it; both of which are challenging enough without the added threat of labour shortages and economic instability.\n\n14% of respondents said investing in AI was their number one priority in 2024, in recognition of the potential of AI to surpass peers and strengthen their company proposition.\n\nHiring and recruitment\n\nToday\u2019s tight labour market has made finding a qualified candidate for a role an impossible task. Working-age people are leaving the workforce in droves, and businesses find themselves constantly needing to fill workforce gaps.\n\n80% of surveyed businesses told us they plan to expand their staff in the next year, with one-in-five describing it as their main priority.\n\nGiven the increasing cost of a new hire, however, there is a need to balance scale-up with survival. Limited resources, plus a troubling economic landscape, mean SMEs often can't compete on salary alone.\n\nThat\u2019s why many companies are attempting to entice talent by offering benefits like flexible working arrangements or meaningful work to differentiate themselves from the market.\n\nHiring from abroad\n\nWe\u2019ve explained the need to bridge the digital skills gap for small businesses to innovate. Last year, the government drastically moved the goalposts on this challenge by raising the minimum salary requirement for hiring talent from abroad.\n\nFrom 11 April, the lowest amount of money a person can earn to qualify for a working visa in the UK will rise to \u00a329,000. This is a huge problem for firms in low-wage sectors, which have historically relied foreign workers to plug gaping talent shortfalls.\n\nAccording to official government data, the occupations with the highest workforce born outside the UK are manufacturers (40.4%) and retail workers (24.3%).\n\nBoth sectors are low-wage and unlikely to meet the new visa requirements, with 13% of manufacturing firms and 10% of retailers telling us they will already struggle to offer workers a competitive salary this year.\n\nEmployee pay demands\n\nAverage salaries have surged by record amounts this year as companies \u2013 including almost every major UK supermarket \u2013 attempt to match skyrocketing inflation and maintain a competitive edge in the talent wars.\n\nThe result is a race to the top for workers, who are demanding a pay rise to cover spiralling household bills. Tellingly, payroll and benefits are now the largest financial burdens for SMEs, with a quarter of companies naming these as their biggest expenditure.\n\nOverall, 71% of respondents think they will be able to meet wage expectations this year. But the level of optimism varies dramatically sector-to-sector.\n\nTech firms, which have historically offered fattened wage packets to entice talent, displayed the most confidence with 80% of businesses in this industry saying they\u2019d be likely or very likely to accommodate pay rises.\n\nThat said, the low-wage hospitality and retail sector, where staff shortages have already made employees hard to recruit, were less optimistic.\n\n19% of restaurants and cafes said they\u2019d be unable to meet employee pay expectations this year. The incoming National Minimum Wage rise, which will raise average hourly wage worker pay by over \u00a31,000 a year, will only add to budgeting concerns.\n\nGlobal geopolitical situations\n\nFrom war-torn Ukraine to ongoing tensions in the Middle East, international crises are taking a toll on UK businesses. Here's how:\n\nSupply chain chaos\n\nThe situation in the Middle East has disrupted the smooth flow of goods around the world, throwing hauliers into chaos and creating friction at border crossings. The most affected sectors rely on a steady flow of raw materials to produce goods. For example construction businesses, 17% of whom said supply chain disruption was their main concern.\n\nHowever, a notable percentage of firms in our survey expressed concern. This included those within sectors such as creative media (10%) and hospitality (9%), demonstrating how any business can be impacted by supply chain woes \u2013 even those not directly involved in international trade.\n\nCurrency fluctuations\n\n16% of fintech and finance companies (the most of any industry) labelled geopolitical situations as their biggest challenge in 2024. Such tensions tend to create volatility in financial markets, making it difficult for fintechs to offer stable and reliable services.\n\nInvestors will struggle to offer advice due to fluctuating stock prices. Meanwhile, regulations such as the sanctions placed on Russia, might restrict how companies operate and do business with international partners.\n\nIncreased oil prices\n\nBoth Russia and the Middle Eastern region are major exporters of crude oil. The disruption caused by wars in Ukraine and Gaza saw business gas and electricity costs quadruple last year. Prices are only just starting to stabilise and, with the government\u2019s Energy Bill Discount Scheme ending on April 1, oil and gas prices will remain a cause of stress for SMEs.\n\nRestaurants, cafes, and hotels tend to use more fuel than in other sectors to run equipment costs and heat large establishments. This is why hospitality (35%) and retail (25%) firms were most likely to name utilities and overhead costs as their biggest expense in our survey.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SMEs?\n\nThe UK's 5.6m SMEs are the backbone of the economy, yet they face a relentless barrage of hurdles. Thankfully, as well as a year of challenges, 2024 is a period of change.\n\nThis election year we could see a new government move into Westminster; an outcome welcomed by the majority of SMEs. Our research shows that 58% of business owners believe a change in leadership this year would positively impact their business performance.\n\nShould a new prime minister be installed soon, the various challenges outlined above could become a brief chapter in this year\u2019s business diary. Until then, the unwavering confidence of the small business community is a compelling enough reason for optimism.\n\nNo fewer than 92% of companies told us they feel positively about the year ahead. This outlook positions SMEs as a driving force to meeting the above challenges head-on for enhanced customer service, innovation, and ultimately, economic recovery.",

Hardt Hyperloop plans to start testing prototypes in the coming weeks, after announcing today that it had completed building the infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEuropean startups and research organisations such as Zeleros, based in the Spanish city of Valencia; Nevomo, a Polish company headquartered in Warsaw, and the Swiss non-profit EuroTube, are among those expected to use the facility.\n\n\u201cThis marks a pivotal moment in hyperloop development,\u201d says Sascha Lamme, EHC director. \u201cIt is great that this state-of-the-art facility in the province of Groningen has been brought to life with the support of all our partners, and we can\u2019t wait for the first tests to happen.\u201d\n\nMarinus van der Meijs, cofounder and technology and engineering director at Hardt Hyperloop, says the EHC will allow companies to demonstrate essential technologies needed for hyperloop trains to work, such as magnetic levitation, propulsion, stabilisation and lane-switching at speeds up to 100 km/h.\n\nHyperloop struggles\n\nThe announcement is encouraging news for a sector, inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s dream of travel at near-supersonic speeds, that has struggled with negative headlines in recent months.\n\nHyperloop One, once a high-profile US startup that raised more than $450m since its launch in 2014 from investors including the billionaire founder of Virgin, Richard Branson, shut down last year despite having built some prototypes in the Nevada desert.\n\nLast December, Zeleros, a spinoff of the Polytechnic University of Valencia that raised $15.6m since its launch in 2016, including from the European Innovation Council, had to let 26 people go \u2014 half of its staff and mostly engineers \u2014 to address liquidity problems. The company is now focused on developing pilot projects in a bid to accelerate its market access and wants to integrate its technology in the port of Valencia.\n\nThe EU is still keen on funding the idea, which could take a renewed impetus after China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) announced earlier this year that its hyperloop train prototype achieved 622 km/h in a test run under non-vacuum conditions, and even faster in a low-vacuum tube.",

The team\u2019s \u201cdedication and drive has brought the business back to levels of performance not seen in well over a decade\u201d, he noted.\n\nHe said the company was pursuing an \u201caggressive growth strategy\u2026 both organically and potentially through synergistic M&A [merger & acquisition] opportunities\u201d.\n\nBoard chairman Peter Searle said: \u201c2023 saw a transformation across the business. The foundations were built in the previous two years with Norman Broadbent returning to profitability. The growth in 2023 is testimony to the hard work put in by the team.\n\n\u201cThe culture present throughout the business is one of teamwork, inclusion, quality and delivery. This has been integral in delivering the results that have been achieved. It\u2019s extremely encouraging to see the levels of commitment and ambition across every level of the business.\u201d\n\nSearle went on to say that the company will continue to add both experienced consultants and researchers throughout 2024, as well as continue to \u201creorganise and strengthen\u201d Norman Broadbent\u2019s support functions and invest in technology to bolster growth.\n\n\u201cThe quality of our service has allowed the team to not only weather the challenges but post the best numbers for over 10 years: a net profit of \u00a3300k, NFI of \u00a310.5m and net cash generated from operating activities of \u00a31.7m.\u201d\n\nDavidson said: \u201cDuring 2023, Norman Broadbent placed leaders across the UK, Europe, the US, Australasia and the Middle East covering multiple sectors and disciplines. As this year has proven, our business is well-balanced across both resilient and rapid growth sectors where there is a considerable shortage of leadership talent.\n\n\u201cWe continue to reinforce our cultural anchors through quarterly values awards, engagement surveys, performance reviews, charitable fundraising and community development projects among other activities.\n\n\u201cThe stability of the team is crucial, especially when growing rapidly, and, as in 2022, we were delighted to have had very few regretted leavers in 2023. We recruited a total of 15 very high calibre and culturally aligned colleagues across fee generation, research and support in 2023 and secured another three who started at the beginning of 2024.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say: \u201cThis was a clear mission that we set when I joined the company and a necessary journey that we are on in re-positioning Norman Broadbent as the pre-eminent executive search and interim leadership partner across our chosen markets.\u201d\n\nDavidson also said that \u201ccorporate development activity will be increased in 2024 to identify and assess the potential for both smaller, strategic acquisitions as well as large-scale transformational opportunities\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile difficulties were experienced in FY23 by many businesses across executive search and the broader recruitment industry,\u201d he acknowledged, \u201cwe have delivered and intend to capitalise on our positive momentum to grow the team further in preparation for a broader economic recovery.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Comment below on this story.

Learn More .\n\nThe Phoenix Group Holdings (LSE: PHNX) share price has just spiked upwards. From market close on 18 March to the time of writing on 27 March, the shares have gained 12%.\n\nIt happened after the insurance firm posted strong 2023 results, and there was one specific thing that seems to have made all the difference.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s put this share price boost in context. It was a good week, but Phoenix Group shares are still down 20% in five years.\n\nDividends\n\nI invest mostly in high-yield shares, and there are a good few to choose from in the FTSE 100. Phoenix, with its 10% yield, is high on my list.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s vital to not just go for the biggest yields. And I\u2019d say there are some clues as to which big ones to be wary of.\n\nOne comes from earnings. If a company isn\u2019t bringing in the earnings it needs to cover the cash payments, they might not be sustainable.\n\nMarket sentiment\n\nA look at the share price can give is a clue to what the market thinks of a dividend outlook too. Vodafone is a good example. For years, it offered dividend yields of around 10%.\n\nBut its share price kept on sliding. An annual 10% isn\u2019t much good if you lose half your stake in five years. Which is what happened to Vodafone shares. And now, the dividend is to be slashed in half in 2025.\n\nI had the same fear over Phoenix.\n\nDividend policy\n\nBut when I opened the firm\u2019s 2023 results on 22 March, I had a nice surprise. The company announced a full-year dividend of 52.65p per share, for a 10.8% yield on the previous close.\n\nMore importantly, the board spoke of \u201cthe new progressive and sustainable dividend policy we will operate going forward\u201c.\n\nThere was no real detail, other than a note that said: \u201cThe Board will continue to prioritise the sustainability of our dividend over the very long term. Future dividends and annual increases will continue to be subject to the discretion of the Board, following assessment of longer-term affordability.\u201d\n\nConfidence\n\nNow, a cynic might say you can make a dividend more sustainable by cutting it, and then make it progressive. There\u2019s no hint of a dividend cut really \u2014 I just include this as a worst-case caution.\n\nBut it suggests the Phoenix board has confidence in current dividend levels, at least in the short-to-medium term. And it will prioritise dividends in the long term.\n\nIn a sector like this, I think that\u2019s about as positive as we could hope.\n\nHow high?\n\nWe\u2019re looking at a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which counts against price rise hopes. But forecasts show earnings growing strongly, to put the P/E at 24 by 2026.\n\nThis is in a recovering business that\u2019s been through a few years of losses, and a high P/E can be misleading. But I can see why investors might still be wary.\n\nAnd if Phoenix keeps its yields up, I could see share price gains in the next few years. Even a 50% rise could mean a 6.5% dividend yield.\n\nOf course, if the dividend does drop one year, I\u2019d expect a price fall.",

      "article_text": "News\n\nBy Lauren Bowes\n\nThe Artisanal Spirits Company (ASC), which owns the Scotch Malt Whisky Society (SMWS), saw 8% revenue growth in its financial results for the year ending 31 December 2023 (FY23).\n\nRevenue reached \u00a323.5 million (US$29.7m), with gross margin rising to 63.8%, from 63.6% in FY22. Gross profit delivery increased by 9% to \u00a315m ($18.9m).\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) showed a loss of \u00a3500,000 ($US631,215), although adjusted EBITDA, which excludes non-recurring costs, was \u00a3100,000 (US$126,272).\n\nSpeaking to The Spirits Business, Billy McCarter, CFO of ASC, explained these costs were predominately due to the changes within the executive and senior management teams, including the appointment of CEO Andrew Dane to replace David Ridley, as well as costs incurred in the acquisition of Single Cask Nation (SCN).\n\nThe company said the board was confident \u2018in the ability of the business to deliver more substantial EBITDA in 2024\u2019.\n\nASC had a loss before tax of \u00a33.6m (US$4.5m), which the company said was due to interest and depreciation of its new supply chain facility, Masterton Bond, which is now fully operational.\n\nAlthough there was growth in revenue, gross profit and membership, ASC said the results were \u2018not at the level we had targeted for the year\u2019.\n\nDane explained: \u201cWe delivered a year of growth against a challenging backdrop. That reflects our unique model, where we saw double-digit growth in our membership for the SMWS. That model delivers a high margin.\n\n\u201cIn our trading update in December, we pared our growth and essentially delayed our growth trajectory by a year, in terms of revenue growth and path to profitability. So, while we did grow, it wasn\u2019t quite at the level that we targeted at the start of the year. We\u2019re pleased to see that the full-year results were marginally ahead of the guidance we gave in December.\n\n\u201cWhat is particularly pleasing for me was the acceleration of revenue growth in the year \u2013 it was 8% for the full year, but 12% in the second half of the year (H2), with some particularly pleasing performances last year from places like Europe.\u201d\n\nFY24 has started positively, with \u2018revenue performing in line with expectation\u2019, representing 10% growth on FY23.\n\nCask values\n\nThe market growth of the company\u2019s cask inventory has also grown, with cask sales during FY23 at 4.5 times net book value. Cask sales contributed \u00a32.7m (US$3.41m) of revenue, which the company said offset \u2018a challenging period of trading in China\u2019.\n\nASC revealed it has a cask stock holding of \u00a325.3m ($US32m), which has a notional retail value of around \u00a3500m (US$631m).\n\nDane said that this value was a particular success in his eyes: \u201cIt\u2019s a substantial asset backing to the business.\u201d\n\nSingle Cask Nation\n\nDane cited ASC\u2019s acquisition of SCN, a US-based independent bottler, which occurred after the results period, as an indicator of future growth and part of its ambitions to increase its presence in the US.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition is a strong strategic development and is both complementary and incremental to SMWS in the significant and growing US whisky market,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe remain confident in this US market opportunity, with the very strong finish to 2023 for in-market depletions for SMWS, continuing with double-digit growth in early 2024.\u201d\n\nSCN will remain a distinct business from SMWS and will continue to focus on American whiskey.\n\n\u201cIt has had a really good start \u2013 we acquired it in January and had our first sales in February,\u201d Dane continued. \u201cIt had its first US e-commerce launch in March, with 50% selling out in the first day. It also won the Independent Bottler of the Year award at the Icons of Whisky Awards, which is a big accolade and a good reflection of what Jason [Johnstone-Yellin] and Joshua [Hatton], the two founders, have achieved.\u201d\n\nThe US is SCN\u2019s largest market, but it also has distribution in Europe, the UK, Canada, Germany and Japan. \u201cWe are looking to expand distribution but we also want to leverage those relationships for JG Thompson, which doesn\u2019t export to Canada or Japan, for example,\u201d said Dane.\n\nSMWS\n\nASC revealed the SMWS had surpassed 41,000 members at year-end, up by 10% from 2022. It cited the US and mainland Europe as particular areas of growth (up by 17% and 29% respectively) and highlighted its entry into new Asian markets.\n\nThe brand established a subsidiary in Taiwan in August 2023.\n\nIt said membership retention remained \u2018close\u2019 to its all-time high of 74%, with annual contributions per member at around \u00a3300 (US$379). Although this was down on 2022\u2019s figure (\u00a3326/US$412), lifetime value per member was up by 25% since its initial public offering.\n\nSMWS celebrated its 40th anniversary last year, with events and activations to celebrate. \u201cWe can\u2019t pretend that it\u2019s the 41st anniversary and do it all again,\u201d explained Dane. \u201cThis year needs to be different. But our focus on the core of the business is what makes every bottling of society liquid special.\u201d\n\nFor this year, one big initiative for SMWS will be Scotch and Sherry. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to capture the trend that\u2019s been happening over years and that we\u2019ve been building towards, which is the consumer demand for ex-Sherry cask influenced whisky.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Dane described the SMWS as \u2018the core of the group\u2019.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI would like to extend my thanks and recognition to all the fantastic employees within ASC for the hard work and commitment displayed during the year \u2013 their resilience, innovation and delivery of outstanding experiences for our members continuing to reach new heights.\u201d",

It probably wouldn\u2019t have been the case a couple of years ago. But I think once you get out of the capital, that adoption of Tequila for sipping or in a cocktail is taking shape and slowly starting to evolve but at a slightly slower pace.\u201d\n\nAltos recently launched its ready-to-serve \u2018bar-quality\u2019 Margarita in major UK supermarkets, which can produce five to six servings. The brand also released a range of ready-to-drink canned Margaritas in Australia and New Zealand, but there are no plans to bring the cans to the UK just yet, McCarthy confirmed, as the focus will be on the bottled Classic Lime Margarita.\n\nAltos was co-founded by bartender Dre Masso, who has been involved in the London cocktail scene for decades. As such, the UK remains a key market for the brand, with Masso often involved in events run by Altos, including the Tahona Society Competition.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a product that was created by bartenders and for bartenders, it has instantly got a bit of credibility with the trade,\u201d McCarthy said, of the brand\u2019s popularity among bartenders.\n\nIn London, Altos recently launched its inaugural Margarita Masters competition for bartenders, with the hope of taking it nationwide in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nIn London, the Margarita moved up four places into the top 10 most popular cocktails list (CGA top 50 cocktails. EPOS Cocktail Report 15.12.23), ahead of the Zombie and Pi\u00f1a Colada.\n\nThe Pornstar Martini remained in the top spot, followed by the Aperol Spritz (which moved up seven places), Sex on the Beach, Long Island Iced Tea, Espresso Martini, Spritz and Mojito. Tequila\u2019s share of cocktails is now up to 11.9%, the CGA report noted.\n\nThe Margarita was also the most-searched cocktail on Google.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown-Forman\u2019s El Jimador was the biggest-selling 100% agave Tequila brand in the UK, data from IWSR in July revealed.",

      "article_text": "Twelve million people. Add up the populations of London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Glasgow, Birmingham and Sheffield, and you\u2019ll be in the right ballpark.\n\nWhy does this number matter? Tragically, this is how many people in the UK are living in absolute poverty \u2013 across both urban and rural areas \u2013 according to recent official estimates. This number is staggering.\n\nFood and poverty are, of course, closely linked. Household food insecurity in the UK has been getting worse. According to the same set of official statistics, the percentage of individuals living in food-secure households was 89% in the financial year ending 2023, down from 93% in the previous year.\n\nIt is an indictment on successive UK governments and others in positions of power that so many are facing poverty and household food insecurity. It particularly matters for the food sector. That\u2019s because some businesses are partly responsible through their misplaced actions or inaction.\n\nIt manifests in large swathes of the public being unable to eat decent food. Many of the people producing and selling our food are struggling, too. Meanwhile, a lack of access to decent, affordable, nutritious food is leading to deepening health inequalities and a public health crisis.\n\nRather than further entrenching food surplus redistribution efforts as the answer, we urgently need to address the root causes of poverty: low wages and a dysfunctional social security system. Not to mention skyrocketing rent and mortgage rates, fuel and energy bills.\n\nNew polling data from More in Common, commissioned by the Food, Farming & Countryside Commission (FFCC), shows 68% of the public say it is the government\u2019s job to make sure healthy food is affordable to all. High time for a right to good food across the UK?\n\nThere are rallying cries not just for more government accountability, but also for greater fairness. In FFCC\u2019s latest polling, 62% wanted greater government intervention to ensure farmers are treated fairly.\n\nSo food business leaders need to act on supply chain injustices too. Much as fairness can win votes, I\u2019m a believer that food businesses that treat workers, the public, suppliers, farm animals and nature fairly will benefit and thrive in the long term too.\n\nWith the impending arrival of an Agricultural Supply Chain Adjudicator, there\u2019s an opportunity for fairer dealings at, and beyond, the farmgate. Crucially, we\u2019d love to see the legislation change to allow this new adjudicator to share insights with the existing Groceries Code Adjudicator \u2013 which strangely it\u2019s not currently allowed to do, even though their remits should intersect. Effective adjudication is essential for ensuring real change at industry level.\n\nWe know that many farmers get 1% or less of the price people pay at the checkout for their food. At the same time, people are struggling to afford good food. Where is the money going? Something needs to change.\n\nOf course, the problems of the food system are not only about money. There are too many people disempowered and disengaged from where their food comes from. A lack of access to good food is not just about nutrition \u2013 it\u2019s also about culture, wellbeing, connection and belonging. We\u2019re more than just passive consumers at the end of a long, often opaque, chain. We need to foster more ways for people to connect with food and be nourished, beyond the size of their wallets.\n\nGrocery leaders, now is the time to listen to citizen voices and take steps to address poverty in your own communities, including your workforce. They\u2019re depending on you.",

A suggestion that he would be at risk of persecution if he returned to Afghanistan was supported by a vicar.\n\nA huge search operation was launched for Ezedi after the attack on 31 January, with CCTV images showing serious injuries to his face. His body was recovered from the River Thames a few weeks later.\n\nMr Griffith told Kay Burley on Breakfast: \"We can't run an asylum system based on credulous clerics and lefty lawyers.\n\n\"That is why we are fundamentally reforming it.\"\n\nChallenged on what he meant by \"credulous clerics\", Mr Griffith said: \"To be credulous is not to be, you know, diligent and inquiring and accept that this could be something that is being faked for that purpose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And we know, we know about this particular case, but we do know that there are loophole lawyers that are grooming people...\"\n\nMr Griffith initially stuck by his use of the word \"grooming\" before agreeing that \"coaching\" was a \"better word\".\n\nPolitics live: Labour blasts Tory 'neglect' of NHS\n\nImage: Abdul Ezedi\n\nA source close to the home secretary said the consequences of Ezedi having his asylum case approved were \"appalling\".\n\n\"That reputational risk is only amplified by the fact some who denied knowledge of Ezedi at the time had in fact known of him within their church, and had supported and vouched for him.\"\n\nAs well as the documents coming to light, Sky News has also obtained pictures of Ezedi, who was also a convicted sex offender, being baptised in church.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nMr Griffith highlighted how Ezedi had not originally claimed asylum on the grounds of his religion and said the government's Safety of Rwanda Bill - which will see certain migrants deported to the east African country - would help prevent similar cases arising again.\n\nLabour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The home secretary must explain why his department failed to remove Ezedi from the UK in the two years after his first asylum claim was rejected - particularly after he was convicted of sexual offences.\"",

His body was later found in the Thames.\n\nExplosive new details about Ezedi's case \u2013 including his failure to correctly answer questions about Christianity and his 'safeguarding contract' \u2013 were disclosed yesterday after the Mail led a media fight to shed light on the case.\n\nThe 35-year-old Afghan national had twice been refused asylum by the Home Office, and was considered so dangerous by the Baptist Church that it drew up a 'safeguarding contract' for the safety of parishioners over his sex assault and exposure convictions.\n\nToday, MPs criticised both the Government and the church for the way Ezedi's case was handled.\n\nLabour said the Government had serious questions to answer over how Ezedi was able to remain in the UK.\n\nClapham chemical attacker Abdul Ezedi was given a Muslim funeral and burial, despite claiming to have converted to Christianity\n\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Home Secretary James Cleverly needed to explain why the sex offender was able to remain in the country two years after his first asylum claim was rejected.\n\nMs Cooper said: 'The latest disturbing revelations about the Abdul Ezedi case raise some serious and urgent questions for the Home Office.\n\n'The Home Secretary must explain why his department failed to remove Ezedi from the UK in the two years after his first asylum claim was rejected - particularly after he was convicted of sexual offences.'\n\nEzedi was found to have 'not been honest in several aspects of his account' by the asylum judge who heard his appeal to stay in the UK.\n\nIn spite of his concerns, Judge William O'Hanlon allowed Ezedi's appeal on asylum and human rights grounds, overturning the Home Office's decision not to grant him leave to remain.\n\nTory Tim Loughton said more guidance was needed for church ministers who were 'taken in' by individuals like Ezedi\n\nA video showing the 35-year-old Afghan national being laid to rest aired on the BBC last night. His funeral was allegedly held at a mosque in west London before he was given a Muslim burial at a ceremony in east London on March 11\n\nHe said: 'The tribunal overturned his refusal, despite the evidence it was all a bit of a scam, largely based on the evidence of a Baptist minister.\n\nAbdul Ezedi timeline 2016 Ezedi, an Afghan refugee, arrived illegally in Britain on the back of a lorry. He had two applications for asylum rejected. 2018 Two years after his asylum was rejected, Ezedi, still living in Britain, was convicted of a sexual assault/exposure offence at Newcastle Crown Court. He pleaded guilty to one charge of sexual assault and one of exposure, the CPS confirmed. He was sentenced on January 9, 2018, to a nine-week jail term suspended for two years for the sexual assault. For the exposure he was given 36 weeks' imprisonment to be served consecutively, which was also suspended for two years. 2020 Ezedi finished his unpaid work order and was discharged from probation supervision. It is understood Ezedi was granted asylum on a subsequent appeal - despite his criminal history - after getting a priest to vouch that he had converted to Christianity. He said he was 'wholly committed' to his new religion. January 31, 2024 Ezedi is suspected of attacking his former girlfriend and her two daughters, aged three and eight, with an unknown alkaline substance. Both the mother and her three-year-old suffered 'life-changing injuries'. The elder child is said to have suffered bruising and burn-like injuries. The suspect later appeared at a Tesco store on Caledonian Road, Islington, dressed in a black hoodie and blue T-shirt. He was last seen on CCTV leaning over London's Chelsea Bridge. His disappearance sparked a huge manhunt. February 19 A body was pulled out of the Thames.

He was twice refused permission to remain in the UK\n\nPhotos show the asylum seeker handing out leaflets near the Monument in Newcastle\n\nEzedi walks around Hay's Galleria on the South Bank in London\n\nBut the documents revealed his inability to answer basic questions on Christianity \u2013 Ezedi claimed the Old Testament was about 'Jesus Christ', while 'Jacob' was one of the 12 disciples.\n\nClaims he had been shot by the Taliban and that he was a Shia Muslim were also debunked in the asylum process.\n\nEzedi arrived in the UK in January 2016, but his initial asylum claim was rejected by the Home Office, as was an appeal in 2017.\n\nIn January 2018, he was placed on the sex offender register for 10 years and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty to charges of sexual assault and exposure.\n\nJust over a year later, in March 2019, he made an appeal over his asylum claim with the First-tier Tribunal's Immigration and Asylum Chamber, arguing he feared persecution because of his religion.\n\nA judge accepted this and allowed his appeal in November 2020, despite doubts about his conversion being 'genuine and long-lasting' from the Home Office.\n\nScience minister Andrew Griffith said the incident demonstrated the need for the Government's Rwanda bill, which would help prevent future cases.\n\nThe Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill is currently caught in a legislative tussle between the House of Commons and House of Lords over concerns about human rights and judicial oversight.\n\nMr Griffith told Sky News: 'We can't run an asylum system based on credulous clerics and lefty lawyers. That is why we are fundamentally reforming it.'\n\n'We are a couple of busloads of peers away in terms of the votes to be able to get [the Bill] through the House of Lords and then that will create the system that we want, that would have prevented this tragic case.'\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: 'All asylum claims are carefully considered on their individual merits in accordance with the Immigration Rules. This means that religious conversions do not guarantee a grant of asylum.\n\nEzedi arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry in 2016 and had twice been refused asylum by 2018\n\nA reference from a Baptist chapel in the North East, where Ezedi was living, was crucial in persuading an immigration tribunal that he had converted from Islam to Christianity. He's pictured out shopping in Newcastle\n\n'We have engaged with a wide range of stakeholders to help us to improve our policy guidance, training for asylum decision-makers, and to ensure we approach claims involving religious conversion in the appropriate way.'\n\nA spokesperson for the Baptist Union of Great Britain said: 'Baptists Together did not corporately support or sponsor Abdul Ezedi's asylum application.\n\n'A personal letter of support commenting solely on Abdul Ezedi's observed faith journey was written by a retired Baptist Minister.\n\n'The safeguarding contract was a separate issue and was agreed between the church and Abdul Ezedi with guidance from local and regional safeguarding leads using our national template document of the time.'",

double the previous year, figures show.\n\nThe data published by the Environment Agency (EA) reveal there were 464,056 spills in 2023, up 54% from 301,091 in 2022, which the organisation said was partly due to England experiencing its sixth-wettest year on record.\n\nThe figures reveal the frequency and duration of spills from storm overflows, which dump untreated sewage into rivers and the sea, usually during heavy rainfall to stop sewers backing up, amid high levels of public concern and anger over the state of England\u2019s waterways and beaches.\n\nThey were described as \u201cdisappointing\u201d but \u201csadly not surprising\u201d by the EA while campaigners said the scale of discharges was a \u201cfinal indictment of a failing industry\u201d.\n\nThe duration of the sewage spills had more than doubled from 1,754,921 hours hours in 2022, to 3,606,170 hours in 2023, the figures show.\n\nBoth the frequency and duration of spills were also up on 2020 levels, which saw comparable amounts of rainfall.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nAnd the figures are at their highest ever levels, although officials caution that comparisons over the years are difficult as an increasing number of storm overflows have been fitted with monitors over time, and all now have the technology to record spills.\n\nEnvironment Agency director of water Helen Wakeham said the figures were \u201cdisappointing\u201d but \u201csadly not surprising\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to see record investment from the water sector, but we know it will take time for this to be reflected in spill data \u2013 it is a complex issue that won\u2019t be solved overnight.\n\n\u201cNo other country has the level of monitoring we do, with 100% of storm overflows in England now fitted with a monitor.\n\n\u201cWe are better placed than ever before to hold water companies accountable \u2013 thanks to intelligence from our new whistleblower portal, our plans to expand our specialised workforce, new enforcement powers, increased water company inspections and new tools to inform our enforcement work,\u201d she said.\n\nWater Minister Robbie Moore said: \u201cI have been clear that sewage pollution in our waters is unacceptable, which is why in just the last few months we announced a consultation to ban water bosses\u2019 bonuses when criminal breaches have occurred, quadrupled company inspections next year, fast-tracked \u00a3180 million investment to cut spills, launched a whistleblowing portal for water company workers to report breaches and will soon set out our plans to ban wet wipes containing plastic.\n\n\u201cWe demanded that 100% of overflows were monitored by the end of last year as part of our drive to improve transparency.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s data shows water companies must go further and faster to tackle storm overflows and clean up our precious waterways.\u201d\n\nIn response to the figures, a spokesperson for industry body Water UK said: \u201cThese results are unacceptable and demonstrate exactly why we urgently need regulatory approval to upgrade our system so it can better cope with the weather.\n\n\u201cWe have a plan to sort this out by tripling investment which will cut spills by 40% by 2030 \u2013 more than double the Government\u2019s target.\n\n\u201cWe now need the regulator Ofwat to give us the green light so that we can get on with it,\u201d they urged.\n\nThe water companies say they want to triple investment to \u00a310 billion over the period 2025-2030 to tackle the problem, which would be paid for through consumer bills.\n\nJames Wallace, chief executive of campaign group River Action, said: \u201cThe scale of the discharges by water companies is a final indictment of a failing industry.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\u201cHaving run amok with billpayers\u2019 money for decades, they discharged untreated sewage into rivers and coastal waters more than 3.6 million hours last year from 464,000 spills through storm overflows that are supposed to be only used in extreme weather events.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a 105% increase in the number of hours and a 54% increase on spills on the previous year.\n\nHe added: \u201cRather than investing in future-proofing their infrastructure, fixing leaky pipes, upgrading wastewater treatment plants, these international businesses have plundered our most precious natural resource, fresh water.\u201d\n\nHe called for reform of environmental regulators and for failing water companies to be refinanced and restructured to put people above profits.\n\nThe figures also showed there were an average of 33 instances of sewage spills per storm overflow in England last year, up from 23 in 2022.\n\nThis is the second highest annual average since data began in 2016, with the highest being 35 spills per overflow in 2019.\n\nThe figures are for storm overflows where spill data is available, the Environment Agency said.",

While satisfaction with the NHS peaked in 2010, when 70 percent of people were satisfied with the health service, it has since fallen.\n\nChronic shortages are stretching hard-working GPs to breaking point, one doctor warns Getty Images\n\nAnd since 2020, satisfaction has fallen by 29 percentage points. The study of 3,374 people in England, Wales and Scotland also found 52 percent of people were dissatisfied with the NHS, the highest proportion since the survey began. The main reasons for dissatisfaction are waiting times for GP and hospital appointments (71 percent), followed by staff shortages (54 percent) and the Government not spending enough money on the NHS (47 percent). However, support for the founding principles of the NHS remains high, with 91 percent believing the NHS should be free of charge when people need to use it, 82 percent agreeing it should be primarily funded through taxes (82 percent) and 82 percent saying the NHS should be available to everyone.\n\n\n\nAn overwhelming majority agreed that the status quo is unsustainable. A report on the poll found: \u201cA decade of squeezed funding and chronic workforce shortages followed by a global pandemic has left the NHS in a continual state of crisis.\u201d In a marked change, Conservative supporters reported only marginally higher levels of satisfaction with the NHS than Labour supporters in 2023 (29 percent versus 24 percent). Levels of dissatisfaction were similar across supporters of both parties. The survey found that 34 percent of people were satisfied with GP services in 2023, the lowest level of satisfaction recorded since the survey began. Some 41% were dissatisfied. Since 2019, satisfaction with GP services has fallen by 34 percentage points. There were also problems with dentistry, with a record low satisfaction level of 24 percent and a record high dissatisfaction of 48 percent. Satisfaction with both inpatient and outpatient hospital services remain at record low levels. When asked what the most important priorities for the NHS should be, the top two were making it easier to get a GP appointment (52 percent) and increasing the number of staff in the NHS (51 percent). Improving waiting times for planned operations and in A&E were chosen by 47 percent and 45 percent of people respectively.\n\nPublic satisfaction with social care has fallen to 13 percent, the lowest level since the survey began Getty Images Public satisfaction with social care has fallen to 13 percent, the lowest level since the survey began. The King\u2019s Fund and the Nuffield Trust sponsor the health and care questions in the poll, which is carried out by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen). Their analysis report said: \u201cDespite record lows in satisfaction, the public remains overwhelmingly behind the principles of the NHS. \u201cThe last few years have seen large falls in satisfaction but support for the founding principles behind the NHS \u2013 free at the point of use, available to everyone, and primarily funded through taxes \u2013 has remained constant. \u201cChanging the model of the NHS is not something the public wants \u2013 they just want the model they have got to work.\u201d Dan Wellings, senior fellow at the King\u2019s Fund, told a briefing the \u201cresults are bleak, but should not be surprising after a year of strikes, scandals and sustained long waits for care.\u201d He added: \u201cWith the health service increasingly unable to meet the expectations and needs of those who rely on it, public satisfaction with the NHS is now in uncharted territory. \u201cAhead of the upcoming general election, political leaders should take note of just how far satisfaction with this celebrated public institution has fallen.\u201d",

Since 2020, satisfaction has fallen by 29 percentage points.\n\nMore than 3,000 people were polled by the National Centre for Social Research across England, Wales and Scotland.

When asked about the reasons, 71 per cent of respondents said it took too long to get an appointment, while 54 per cent said the centres were understaffed.\n\nAround 47 per cent felt the government was not spending enough money, while 32 per cent felt NHS was wasting money.\n\nSatisfaction with GP services and NHS dental care has fallen to the lowest-ever level \u2013 just 24 per cent for both services.\n\nHowever, an overwhelming majority felt the NHS should retain its founding principles.

In the first half, the Poles had a dangerous moment from a Bartosz Slisz cross, with Karol Swiderski just missing the ball. Just before the break, Ben Davies directed the ball into Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny\u2019s goal, but the goal was disallowed for being offside.\n\nThe hosts pressed at the start of the second half. In the 48th minute, Kieffer Moore headed precisely, but Szcz\u0119sny responded with an even better save. After a spell of clear Welsh dominance, the game balanced out. The Poles managed to hold onto the ball but lacked decisiveness in front of Danny Ward\u2019s goal.\n\nRegulation time ended without a result for either side, and the match went into extra time, where both teams had their chances. Jakub Piotrowski came close to scoring, but his shot narrowly missed the post. Ultimately, the match went to penalties to decide the Euro 2024 qualifier, with Poland triumphing 5:4.\n\nScorers for the White and Reds included Robert Lewandowski, Sebastian Szyma\u0144ski, Przemys\u0142aw Frankowski, Nicola Zalewski, and Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek.\n\nPoland is now set to play in Group D at Euro 2024 in Germany, alongside France, the Netherlands, and Austria.",

Attendees sat in a square formation around a large red, orange and green floral installation, a video released by state media showed.\n\nThe audience with Xi follows Chinese Premier Li Qiang not meeting visiting foreign CEOs at the China Development Forum in Beijing on March 24-25, which prompted concerns over transparency in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nThe chance to exchange views with Beijing\u2019s second-ranking leader had become a key element of the summit in previous years.\n\nWednesday\u2019s meeting followed on from a dinner in November with US executives in San Francisco, where Xi received a standing ovation.",

The move came after the United States blocked Chinese access to advanced chips and the equipment to make them, citing security concerns, and urged its allies to follow suit.\n\nAn online report from state broadcaster CCTV did not mention the chip machinery, but quoted Xi as saying that the creation of scientific and technological barriers and the fragmentation of the industrial and supply chains will lead to division and confrontation.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese people also have the right to legitimate development, and no force can stop the pace of China\u2019s scientific and technological development and progress,\u201d Xi said, according to CCTV.\n\nRutte and Trade Minister Geoffrey van Leeuwen were also expected to discuss the wars in Ukraine and Gaza during meetings with Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang, a Dutch government release said ahead of their trip.\n\nDutch company ASML is the world\u2019s only producer of machines that use extreme ultraviolet lithography to make advanced semiconductors. In 2023, China became ASML\u2019s second-largest market, accounting for 29% of its revenue as Chinese companies bought up equipment before the licensing requirement took effect.\n\nBeijing has repeatedly accused the U.S. of trying to hold back China\u2019s economic development by restricting access to technology. In response, Xi has launched a campaign to develop home-grown chips and other high-tech products.\n\n\u201cChina always opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security and making various excuses to coerce other countries into imposing a technological blockade against China,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in January.\n\nNATO and its growing ties with Asia also may come up at Wednesday\u2019s talks. Rutte is a leading candidate to be the next head of NATO, an organization that China has criticized for provoking regional tensions and making forays into the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nChina has also taken a neutral position on the Ukraine war, providing Russia with diplomatic cover and economic support through trade. That stance has angered and frustrated much of Europe, which sees Russia as the aggressor and Ukraine as the victim.\n\nASML, the Netherlands\u2019 largest company, recently threatened to leave the country over anti-immigration policies that may impact the company\u2019s ability to hire talent, leaving government officials scrambling to ensure that the firm does not leave.\n\nVan Leeuwen said this week in an interview with The FD, a Dutch business newspaper, that protecting the interests of ASML is a top priority but acknowledged that national security comes before economic interests.\n\n___\n\nSoo reported from Hong Kong.",

The previous two attacks targeted a Pakistan naval air base and a strategic port used by China in the southwest province of Balochistan where Beijing is investing billions in infrastructure projects.\n\nPakistani authorities said they will now perform DNA testing on the remains of the suicide bomber who attacked the Chinese engineers. China is also expected to send its own experts to the attack site for an independent investigation along with a joint probe with Pakistan.\n\nPakistani officials said they shared the latest investigation developments with their Chinese counterparts.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s attack, the Chinese engineers were returning from Islamabad and were en route to their camp at the dam construction site in Dasu in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, regional police chief Mohammad Ali Gandapur said.\n\n\"Five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in the attack,\" Mr Gandapur said.\n\nA major dam\u2019s site, Dasu was previously attacked in 2021 and has remained under terrorist threat in Pakistan.\n\nPakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif went to the Chinese embassy on Tuesday afternoon after the attack and offered condolences to the victims\u2019s families and the Chinese government.\n\nHe is expected to visit Beijing next week, marking his first official visit after coming to power in February.\n\nNo one has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. Pakistan is home to twin insurgencies \u2013 one by Islamists and the other by ethnic militants.\n\nIslamists mostly operate in Pakistan\u2019s northwest, the area where the convoy was attacked.\n\nHowever, the Taliban\u2019s off-shoot in Pakistan, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied being behind the attack in a statement Wednesday, saying: \u201cWe are in no way related to the attack on the Chinese engineers.\u201d\n\nThe multiple attacks threaten China\u2019s trusting alliance with Pakistan as the nation has continued to offer Islamabad support monetarily and diplomatically.\n\nChina also sends engineers to Pakistan on a number of projects as Beijing invests over $65bn in infrastructure works as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under Beijing\u2019s wider Belt and Road initiative.",

There were very curious things taking place and I didn\u2019t necessarily understand it,\u201d he said, laughing, adding that he felt like a little brother during the time he spent with the Bad Boy Records boss.\n\nWhen Stern asked whether he would send his own kids to Puffy Flavor Camp, Usher exclaimed: \u201cHell no!\u201d\n\nAuthorities are now investigating whether Diddy may have been engaging in sex trafficking, and have seized his phones and computers from his Los Angeles and Miami homes.\n\nThe raid Monday came almost one day to the month since Rodney \u201cLil Rod\u201d Jones \u2014 a former producer and videographer for Diddy \u2014 filed an explosive lawsuit claiming the music mogul repeatedly sexually assaulted him from September 2022 to November 2023.\n\nJones accused Combs of groping his genitals and grooming him into having sex.\n\n6 Authorities are now investigating whether Diddy may have been engaging in sex trafficking. FilmMagic\n\nA former NYPD detective in the rap intelligence unit said he believes \u201csomeone is behind\u201d these investigations, \u201csomeone who really wants to destroy his brand and take him down.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s giving [authorities] sensitive information. Someone\u2019s cooperating, and it\u2019s probably someone close to him,\u201d said Derrick Parker, who was assigned to two of Diddy\u2019s more infamous cases in New York in the 1990s and knew the rapper well.\n\n\u201cThis looks, to me, like the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nBut an attorney representing Diddy has slammed the investigation as \u201cnothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer noted that Diddy has not been arrested or charged and has spoken to and cooperated with authorities.\n\nThe rapper\u2019s travel has also not been restricted in any way, the lawyer added.",

Accordingly, the Board is progressing its discussions with International Paper regarding the Proposal,\" DS Smith said. It said it was continuing talks with Mondi.\n\nMondi declined to comment.\n\nLate last year, rival paper and packaging company Smurfit Kappa announced its acquisition of WestRock in an $11 billion deal, which is still pending closure.\n\nInternational Paper's interest in DS Smith is unexpected given the company's recent focus on its North American business, Morningstar analyst Spencer Liberman said.",

That means Trump is still far away from a windfall, which will be tied to how well the shares do over the next few months.\n\nAnd analysts have warned that shares in Trump Media may already be over valued given it has yet to make a profit.\n\n\"The valuation of the business is rich relative to its underlying fundamentals,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital.\n\n\"This valuation may be more of a proxy on the enthusiasm of supporters for Trump than a reasonable estimate of underlying business prospects.\"\n\nTrump Media's Nasdaq debut came after it completed its merger with Digital World Acquisition, a so-called 'spac' or stock market-listed shell company.\n\nTruth Social has 8.9m account holders but just 5m active users compared with 550m on X, which used to be called Twitter.\n\nTrump's firm brought in just \u00a32.6m in revenue in the first nine months of last year and lost nearly \u00a340m as it continues to burn through cash.\n\nAJ Bell investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said the surge in the share price was \"completely out of kilter\" with the current business.\n\nTrump first launched Truth Social in February 2022 as a rival social network to what he called \"liberal media consortium\".\n\nHe said the social media app, which has a similar feed to X, would be a \"fight back against the Big Tech companies of Silicon Valley\".\n\nBut its creation came as Trump reeled from his ban from X, Facebook and Instagram following the January 6 Capitol Hill riot.\n\nDuring his time in the White House, Trump used social media to reveal policy decisions, fire aides and argue with critics, and considered it a vital means of communication with his 88m followers, many of them supporters.\n\nIn a statement this week, Trump Media chief executive Devin Nunes, a former House Republican, said: \"As a public company, we will passionately pursue our vision to build a movement to reclaim the Internet from Big Tech censors.\"\n\nThe company also plans to launch its own streaming service, which would be a 'non-woke' alternative to the likes of giant Netflix.\n\nBut its future is very much dependent on the whims of Trump.\n\nThe company, which is based in Florida, said in a regulatory filing that it \"is highly dependent on the popularity and presence of President Trump\".\n\nThat gave the company a value of over \u20ac8.1bn - making Trump's 58pc stake worth \u20ac5.7bn. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nIt added that if the media personality were to limit or discontinue his relationship with the company, including due to his campaign to regain the presidency, the company \"would be significantly disadvantaged\".\n\nThe company's board is also loaded with Trump's closest allies, including his son.\n\nThis has led to some experts calling the company a so-called meme stock - comparing it to GameStop and AMC, which skyrocketed during the pandemic thanks to a push from retail traders.",

Notably, it showed substantial gains in pre-market trading, rising by 13.73% for a current valuation of $65.95.\n\nDJT stock 24-hour price chart. Source: Google Finance\n\nThe spike in DJT stock value generated billions for Trump\n\nWhen DJT stock debuted on the market and began trading, it quickly surged by over 55% on its first day. This significant increase meant that DJT shares had risen by more than 100% over the past five days and an astonishing 375% throughout the year.\n\nDJT stock surge. Source: The Kobeissi Letter\n\nConsequently, this surge propelled Trump\u2019s net worth to $6.5 billion, elevating him into the ranks of the top 500 wealthiest individuals.\n\nTruth Social, a platform under Trump Media, generated only $3.3 million in revenue during the first nine months of last year while incurring a loss of nearly $50 million.\n\nWhy is DJT stock performance important for Trump?\n\nThis launch is crucial for Donald Trump, who is in need of funds to settle legal penalties and owns more than half of the company\u2019s shares. However, he is unable to sell his shares for at least six months, limiting his immediate access to funds.\n\nIf Trump were to sell a substantial portion of his shares, it could negatively impact the share price. Investors also face risks linked to Trump\u2019s political fortunes and his potential 2024 presidential campaign. While a loss could dampen the DJT share price, a win could potentially boost it.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that interest in Trump Media has been driven largely by individual investors, many of whom appear to be Trump supporters, rather than by traditional Wall Street firms. These individual investors tend to base their interest more on personal allegiance rather than on the financial performance metrics typically used by institutional investors to assess intrinsic value.\n\nBuy stocks now with eToro \u2013 trusted and advanced investment platform\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

      "article_text": "Shares in Donald Trump\u2019s social media business soared on their stock market debut in New York yesterday \u2013 valuing the former US president\u2019s stake at nearly \u00a35billion.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group, which is behind his Truth Social platform, rose almost 60 per cent to $79 on the Nasdaq in early trading.\n\nThat gave the company a value of over \u00a37billion \u2013 making Trump\u2019s 58 per cent stake worth \u00a34.9billion.\n\nThe stock \u2013 which trades under the \u2018ticker\u2019 DJT in a nod to Trump\u2019s initials \u2013 later closed up 16 per cent at $57.99.\n\nThe rally will come as a welcome boost for Trump, 77, as he faces huge legal bills while at the same time running for president again.\n\nFlying start: Trump Media & Technology Group, which is behind the Truth Social platform, rose almost 60% to $79 on the Nasdaq in early trading\n\nHowever, lock-up restrictions could prevent him from selling or borrowing against his shareholding for six months.\n\nThat means Trump is still far away from a windfall, which will be tied to how well the shares do over the next few months.\n\nAnd analysts have warned that shares in Trump Media may already be overvalued given it has yet to make a profit.\n\n\u2018The valuation of the business is rich relative to its underlying fundamentals,\u2019 said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital.\n\n\u2018This valuation may be more of a proxy on the enthusiasm of supporters for Trump than a reasonable estimate of underlying business prospects.\u2019\n\nTrump Media\u2019s Nasdaq debut came after it completed its merger with Digital World Acquisition, a so-called \u2018spac\u2019 or stock market-listed shell company.\n\nTruth Social has 8.9m account holders but just 5m active users compared with 550m on X, which used to be called Twitter.\n\nTrump\u2019s firm brought in just \u00a32.6million in revenue in the first nine months of last year and lost nearly \u00a340million as it continues to burn through cash.\n\nAJ Bell investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said the surge in the share price was \u2018completely out of kilter\u2019 with the current business.\n\nTrump first launched Truth Social in February 2022 as a rival social network to what he called the \u2018liberal media consortium\u2019.\n\nHe said the social media app, which has a similar feed to X, would be a \u2018fight back against the Big Tech companies of Silicon Valley\u2019.\n\nBut its creation came as Trump reeled from his ban from X, Facebook and Instagram following the January 6 Capitol Hill riot.\n\nDuring his time in the White House, Trump used social media to reveal policy decisions, fire aides and argue with critics, and considered it a vital means of communication with his 88m followers, many of them supporters.\n\nIn a statement this week, Trump Media chief executive Devin Nunes, a former House Republican, said: \u2018As a public company, we will passionately pursue our vision to build a movement to reclaim the Internet from Big Tech censors.\u2019\n\nThe company also plans to launch its own streaming service, which would be a \u2018non-woke\u2019 alternative to the likes of giant Netflix.\n\nBut its future is very much dependent on the whims of Trump. The company, which is based in Florida, said in a regulatory filing that it \u2018is highly dependent on the popularity and presence of President Trump\u2019.\n\nIt added that if the media personality were to limit or discontinue his relationship with the company, including due to his campaign to regain the presidency, the company \u2018would be significantly disadvantaged\u2019.\n\nThe company\u2019s board is also loaded with Trump\u2019s closest allies, including his son.\n\nThis has led to some experts calling the company a so-called meme stock \u2013 comparing it to GameStop and AMC, which skyrocketed during the pandemic thanks to a push from retail traders.",
