      "article_text": "Embarking on the apprenticeship journey offers a multitude of benefits for businesses, a subject we\u2019ve previously explored in Ten compelling reasons to integrate apprenticeships into your business strategy. However, initiating this venture often raises numerous questions for employers, including the intricacies of apprenticeship contracts, appropriate salary benchmarks, and holiday entitlements. This guide is designed to address these queries and provide you with some top tips to ensure a successful start to your apprenticeship programme with CMS Vocational Training Ltd.\n\nENSURING APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\n\nA primary concern for employers is to comply with the legal minimum wage requirements for apprentices, which may be lower than the standard national minimum wage. This obligation integrates smoothly into standard payroll processes, with the added benefit that apprentices may qualify for National Insurance contribution exemptions under certain circumstances. For comprehensive guidelines, please refer to the UK Government National Minimum Wage Rates.\n\nCMS would encourage employers to consider offering compensation that exceeds the minimum requirements, including potential bonuses or commissions, to enhance motivation and express appreciation for the apprentice\u2019s contributions.\n\nLEVERAGING FINANCIAL SUPPORT: NAVIGATING GRANTS AND FUNDING\n\nThe financial implications of hiring an apprentice are mitigated by available grants, a topic detailed in Apprenticeships: Funding for Employers. Should you require assistance with determining eligibility or navigating the application process, our team is available for consultation. Contact us at 01924 470477, email info@cmsvoc.co.uk or explore further at Apprenticeship Funding.\n\nCLARIFYING EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS: HOURS AND ENTITLEMENTS\n\nIt is essential to present apprentices with a contract of employment that guarantees the same holiday entitlement as other employees. Standard working hours for apprentices range from 30 to 40 hours per week, with provisions for additional training and assessment. For employees transitioning to an apprenticeship role, it is standard practice for their wages to remain constant, albeit with the advantage of acquiring qualifications at no additional expense.\n\nDETERMINING THE DURATION OF APPRENTICESHIP COMMITMENTS\n\nThe length of an apprenticeship can vary, necessitating a commitment of at least one year (and seven days), with the possibility of extension up to four years for higher-level apprenticeships. This duration should be customised to suit both the employer\u2019s operational needs and the apprentice\u2019s vocational aspirations.\n\nMANAGING THE APPRENTICESHIP EXPERIENCE: FROM CHALLENGES TO SUCCESS\n\nIdentifying and nurturing potential within apprentices allows for strategic planning for their career progression post-apprenticeship, whether through further training or a transition to full-time employment. Encountering challenges is a part of the process, wherein the support of a reputable training provider is invaluable, ensuring any issues are addressed promptly and effectively.\n\nPOST-APPRENTICESHIP: ADVANCING CAREER DEVELOPMENT\n\nWhile there is no obligation to offer permanent positions upon completion of an apprenticeship, it is a practice many employers adopt, valuing the investment in a well-trained, dedicated individual who is already integrated into the company culture. Offering further training opportunities within the organization can also be beneficial, supporting ongoing professional development.\n\nINITIATING YOUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMME\n\nFor those considering the implementation of an apprenticeship program or seeking detailed information on specific apprenticeship pathways, such as HR, Learning and Development, Leadership and Management, Business Administration, Customer Service, or Health & Fitness, please contact us at 01924 470477 or via email at info@cmsvoc.co.uk.",

      "article_publisher": "OilPrice.com",
      "article_text": "The global LNG market could face a sea change in prices and trade flows later this decade if the European Union includes LNG in its carbon border tax.\n\nThe EU\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), commonly known as the \u201ccarbon border tax,\u201d was launched on October 1 in the first transitional phase for imports of several carbon-intensive groups of products into the European Union.\n\nThe first phase of the EU\u2019s carbon import pricing legislation will not impose levies on the products\u2014such will apply from 2026. However, importers of iron and steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizer, hydrogen, and electricity into the EU will be asked\u2014as of now\u2014to report on the volume of their imports and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions embedded during their production, although they will not be paying any financial adjustment at this stage.\n\nLNG is currently left out of the carbon border tax, so imports are not being additionally taxed right now.\n\nBut, the EU has extended its Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) to shipping, which means that LNG cargoes into Europe will be subject to a carbon tax from 2024.\n\n\u201cFor now, the first draft only refers to new LNG import contracts, but a methane tax on all LNG imports exceeding defined limits cannot be ruled out,\u201d Wood Mackenzie analysts wrote in a report this week.\n\nThe EU could go further and include LNG in CBAM, setting an import duty at prevailing carbon prices in ETS, WoodMac noted. Related: Why Do we Still Have Investor-Owned Utilities?\n\nIf the bloc were to include LNG in the carbon border tax mechanism, the LNG market would be split into two and become a two-tier market of premium prices in Europe and lower prices in emerging Asian markets, the energy consultancy says in its analysis.\n\nNow, there is a big \u2018if\u2019 in these assumptions. The EU, which currently relies a lot on LNG imports for its natural gas supply \u2013 Russian pipeline gas being mostly out of the picture \u2013 could still need relatively high LNG volumes after 2026 and may not opt for an LNG import duty that is sure to upend global markets.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Europe will juggle its emission reduction targets with energy security.\n\n\u201cIf the EU decides to apply these levies, then this will push European gas prices up but also bifurcate the global LNG market, creating a two-tier LNG market,\u201d said Massimo Di Odoardo, Vice President of Gas & LNG Research at Wood Mackenzie.\n\nThis may not play to Europe\u2019s advantage because LNG exporters with the lowest emissions will benefit the most, but market proximity will be key, including for one of the top exporters, Qatar, which is planning a massive expansion in its export capacity by the end of the decade.\n\nAccording to WoodMac, Qatar and Mozambique, for example, will require high carbon prices in Europe that could lure them away from closer markets in emerging Asia, which are unlikely to introduce an import tax on emissions and which\u2014unlike Europe\u2014are only set to see their demand for LNG rise in the coming years.\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. has some of the world\u2019s highest-emitting LNG projects, with upstream reservoir type and pipeline distance to LNG plants adding to their high methane intensity, per WoodMac\u2019s estimates.\n\nU.S. LNG projects will likely be motivated to act to reduce emissions.\n\nHowever, the scale and extent of future emissions taxes on LNG imports will be critical to reduce emissions in the LNG industry at scale, according to Wood Mackenzie.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf only Europe imposed taxes, it would not achieve the required goal of large-scale decarbonization of LNG projects globally, the constancy notes. The most likely result will be a bifurcate LNG market instead.\n\n\u201cIf there is to be any material impact, a carbon price closer to US$200/t CO2e will be required for LNG imports,\u201d Di Odoardo said.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, this would have to be introduced on a global level for it to be truly effective in reducing carbon intensity and that is unlikely to happen. For now, all eyes will be on Europe to see what it does next.\u201d\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

      "article_text": "The first time I went to Barcelona was on a school tour in 1978. I turned 15 half way through the fortnight away, and that's an age at which a place can leave a lasting impression; I still love it and the surrounding area.\n\nIn the years since, I have been back many times, but usually only to the beach resorts in Catalunya. That's why it was a pleasure to explore the hinterland in a bit more depth, this time in the latest Mazda2 Hybrid.\n\nWe were based in Calafell, about an hour south of Barcelona, and the driving route first took me into Tarragona, where massive yachts, some seized from Russian oligarchs as part of the Ukraine war sanctions, dot the harbour.\n\nThe real fun came afterwards, though. Once away from the urban streets and the motorway, you enter the real Catalunya, a landscape of jagged mountain peaks, and endless vineyards basking under relentless sun.\n\nMy test car was the top-of-the-range Mazda2 Homura Plus variant, which comes with a sunroof, all the better to see that lovely sky. The car is a joint venture with Toyota, so there's the unmistakeable feel of the Yaris about it, though both are equally pretty in the metal.\n\nBusiness Bulletin\n\nThat means there's a certain familiarity about the 1.5-litre petrol engine matched with a 59kW electric motor and a continuous variable transmission (CVT).\n\nI've never been wild about CVTs, because they often feel a little bit wheezy even on relatively unchallenging gradients, but the Mazda2 leapt up the hills if not quite like a gazelle, then certainly like a mountain goat.\n\nOn the straights, it felt solid, despite a sub-4m length, and where that matters is in the assured handling, not just on the country roads but on the motorways too, where outside noise was no match for the good insulation. This is a very quiet car when you're touring.\n\nIrish pricing has yet to be announced, but expect an entry-level model to cost around \u20ac28,000, with Homura Plus more expensive. To the basic spec, it adds a 10.5-inch infotainment display, compared with 9-inch basic, a 12.3-inch digital instrument screen, satnav, head-up display, and voice recognition.\n\nYou also get 17-inch wheels, over the 15-inch on the standard model, and that sunroof.\n\nThere are four grades - Centre-Line, Exclusive-Line, Homura and Homura Plus - and, depending on which one you opt for, you'll get the likes of keyless entry, parking sensors, wireless phone charging and so on.\n\nAll variants come with air conditioning, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, traffic sign recognition, speed assistance, emergency steering assist, and so on. It's a very comprehensive safety package.\n\nAs for looks, well, Mazda always does the business for me in that department, and here it's done enough to make it look different to the Yaris, no matter how marginally.\n\nYou get a distinctive Mazda grille, cats-eye headlights, and a nicely weighted balance between front and rear.\n\nThe large hatchback reveals a cargo space that feels more generous than the advertised 286 litres - 935 with the rear bench folded - and while passenger legroom is just about fine for tall people, the width is more suited to two adults than three.\n\nAt 97g/km, emissions are low enough to attract annual motor tax of just \u20ac170, while fuel consumption of 4.2 litres per 100km is not going to break anyone's bank.\n\nThis also is a very comfortable car. I spent a solid three-and-a-half hours tootling around all sorts of roads and surfaces, and never once felt a sharp jolt, or felt tired behind the wheel.\n\nClassy cloth upholstery helps, and the unfussy fascia feels like everything is where it should be.\n\nMy only regret is that I stopped for a coffee at one stage, at a restaurant with a terrace overlooking vineyards and at the mountain in the distance. There was a lovely bit of heat, even in March, and the sound of birdsong everywhere.\n\nAs it happened, the restaurant was closed, but I sat on the terrace for ten minutes anyway, contemplating what it would be like to wander up here in the afternoon during retirement, sip a lazy glass of one of the local vintages and just watch the world go by.\n\nAt all other times of the day, I certainly would be happy to be back in the Mazda2.\n\nIt's a lovely piece of kit, and certainly should be on your shopping list if you too are thinking of downsizing.\n\nMAZDA2 HYBRID\n\nPRICE TBC\n\nMODEL DRIVEN Homura Plus trim\n\nENGINE 1.5-litre petrol hybrid/59kW electric motor\n\nMAX COMBINED POWER 114hp\n\nTRANSMISSION CVT\n\n0-100KM/H 9.7 seconds\n\nTOP SPEED 175kph\n\nFUEL CONSUMPTION 4.2L/100km\n\nEMISSIONS 97g/km \u20ac170 tax",

      "article_text": "By Lambert Strether of Corrente.\n\nPatient readers, I am buffeted by two enormous firehoses of information: the 2024 election, and Covid. While I do try to present the most important Covid information, there\u2019s so much of it just now that important material gets left on the cutting room floor. So think of this post as my \u201cdirector\u2019s cut\u201d on Covid; the three-and-a-half hour version as opposed to the ninety-minute one that made it into the theatres. (I went through the links from trusted sources I\u2019d flagged to read since March 1 (!), and opened up about 200 tabs, so even the verbose post you are about to read is selective.)\n\nBefore I begin: (1) Covid is not \u201cover\u201d; mass infection from the pandemic continues. (2) Covid is airborne. If you\u2019re feeling the urge right now to dispute either proposition in comments, let me advise you: don\u2019t.\n\nWhat follows is a compendium of worthwhile material I simply haven\u2019t been able to get to, grouped into the following categories: #CovidIsAirborne, Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), Testing, Sequelae, Immune Dysregulation, Children, Social Norming, Gaslighting, Official Maleficence, and Eugenics. Feel free to skip to the category most interesting to you!\n\n* * *\n\n#CovidIsAirborne\n\n\u201cBus Riding as Amplification Mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 Transmission, Germany, 2021\u201d [Emerging Infectious Diseases, CDC]. From the Abstract: \u201cA phylogenetically unique strain and epidemiologic analyses provided a link between air travelers and cases among bus company staff, schoolchildren, other bus passengers, and their respective household members. The attack rate among bus-riding children at 1 school was \u22484 times higher than among children not taking a bus to that school. The outbreak exemplifies how an airborne agent may be transmitted effectively through (multiple) short (<20 minutes) public transport journeys and may rapidly affect many persons.\u201d \u2022 More on the quarantine-breaking driver from CIDRAP here. The first epidemiogical study on airborne tranmssion that I spotted was also from a bus, in March 2020 (from the South China Morning Post, complete with seating chart). Which would make the CDC about \u2014 [allow me to break out my calculator] \u2014 2024 \u2013 2020 = 4 years late. Still, it\u2019s always good to add to the literature!\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 outbreak at a residential apartment building in Northern Ontario, Canada\u201d (accepted manuscript) [Epidemiology and Infection]. \u201cA case-control study examined building-specific exposures and resident behaviours that may have increased the odds of being a case. A professional engineer assessed the building\u2019s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Whole genome sequencing and an in-depth genomic analysis were performed. Forty-five outbreak confirmed cases were identified. From the case-control study, being on the upper floors (OR: 10.4; 95% CI: 1.63-66.9) or within three adjacent vertical lines (OR: 28.3; 3.57-225) were both significantly associated with being a case of COVID-19, after adjusting for age. There were no significant differences in reported behaviours, use of shared spaces, or precautions taken between cases and controls. Assessment of the building\u2019s ventilation found uncontrolled air leakage between apartment units. A single genomic cluster was identified, where most sequences were identical to one another. Findings from the multiple components of this investigation are suggestive of aerosol transmission between units.\u201d \u2022 Amoy Gardens all over again.\n\n\u201cMolecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in saliva and classroom air: a two winters tale\u201d [Clinical Microbiology and Infection]. From the Abstract: \u201cWe analyze saliva, air, and air cleaner filter samples from studies conducted in two Swiss secondary schools (age 14-17 years) over seven weeks during the winters of 2021/22 and 2022/23. Two bioaerosol sampling devices and HEPA filters from air cleaners were used to collect airborne virus particles in five classrooms\u2026. The weekly probability of airborne detection was 34%\u2026 for SARS-CoV-2 and 10%\u2026 for other respiratory viruses. There was a distinct shift in the distribution of respiratory viruses from SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron wave to other respiratory viruses one year later. SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to be detected in the air than other endemic respiratory viruses, possibly reflecting differences in viral characteristics and the composition of virus-carrying particles that facilitate airborne long-range transmission.\u201d\n\nIf only SARS-CoV-2 were visible:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Last Monday, my family was briefly exposed to a symptomatic person who had tested negative on a RAT.

People can still get sick after ventilating a space, so it is important to use ventilation as one part of a multi-layered approach to protect ourselves against getting sick from respiratory viruses\u2026. Respiratory viruses primarily spread in the air between people. The fewer viruses in the air, the better . Improving ventilation can help you reduce virus levels in your home and reduce the chances that the virus will spread.\u201d \u2022 Better late than never.

A good roundup, including this: \u201cRichard Corsi, co-inventor with Jim Rosenthal of the Corsi-Rosenthal box, a DIY air filter, and now dean of engineering at the University of California Davis, also helped address the issue of cost and benefits with figures that are easier to relate to. Corsi said, \u201cWe could put a CR Box in EVERY public school classroom in the United States at a cost of $160M/year. That\u2019s less than one Venti American coffee per student per year (or 0.024% of the average cost of educating a child each year in the US). In doing this calculation I have used a bulk discount for filters, which lowers the cost of a CR box by about 35%. We could do the same with HEPA air cleaners at about twice the price \u2013 1 Grande Mocha Cookie Crumble Frappuccino per student per year.\u201d He estimated the costs would be a bit higher for offices but still relatively low cost, given improved employee performance.

It\u2019s not a matter of \u201cfear of getting COVID again\u201d because I\u2019ve *never* had it. Not once, even though most of my friends and acquaintances are on their third or fourth cases. I haven\u2019t gotten anything else since January, 2020, either. Four years with no COVID, no influenza, no colds. Being sick is a really miserable experience and I\u2019m delighted I haven\u2019t gone through that since the pandemic first began. It\u2019s not a matter of \u201cfear\u201d.

The hospital specializes in treating tuberculosis patients. Dr. Kizilbash says the Elastomeric is highly effective against airborne diseases such as Tuberculosis. She says the center has used them since 1996 and not once did an employee test positive for TB . \u2018They use P100 filters.

Mouse study using aerosolized murine norovirus (MNV) as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2. From the Conclusion: \u201cIn summary, we have shown for the first time that far-UVC light, operating well within current regulatory limits, is able to produce major reductions in the level of airborne viruses in an occupied indoor location . However, unlike controlled laboratory studies, uncertainties related to airflow pattern, residence time, and actual exposure dose experienced by the collected virus introduces uncertainty into the inactivation estimates. Whole-room disinfection with far-UVC is an emerging intervention for pandemic and epidemic control that has the potential to become part of the layered strategic approach to minimize transmission of airborne pathogens in occupied indoor spaces, including ventilation and filtration and, where appropriate, masks and physical distancing.\u201d \u2022 Flagged and discussed by Naomi Wu.

While getting a positive test in just a few minutes can solve the mystery, what if it\u2019s not COVID? Outside of the United States, rapid tests exist for COVID as well as the other primary culprits for cold-weather respiratory symptoms: the flu and RSV.

From the Abstract: \u201cCognitive decline is a common adverse effect of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19), particularly in the post-acute disease phase. The mechanisms of cognitive impairment after COVID-19 (COGVID) remain unclear, but neuroimaging studies provide evidence of brain changes, many that are associated with aging. Therefore, we calculated Brain Age Gap (BAG), which is the difference between brain age and chronological age, in a cohort of 25 mild to moderate COVID-19 survivors (did not experience breathlessness, pneumonia, or respiratory/organ failure) and 24 non-infected controls (mean age = 30 +/\u2212 8) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). BAG was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (F = 4.22, p = 0.046) by 2.65 years. Additionally, 80% of the COVID-19 group demonstrated an accelerated BAG compared to 13% in the control group (X2 = 20.0, p < 0.001). Accelerated BAG was significantly correlated with lower cognitive function (p < 0.041). \u201d\n\n\u201cBlood Markers Show Neural Consequences of LongCOVID-19\u201d [Cells]. N = 33. From the Conclusion: \u201cThis study reports differentially expressed peripheral markers of inflammation and stress after SARS-CoV-2 infection between healthy pre-pandemic controls, people recovered from COVID-19 and neuroLongCOVID-19 subjects. Neurotoxic proteins associated with neurodegeneration were identified from neuronal enriched EVs that differed between the three groups. One or more of the proteins identified in this study have also been shown in other neurological disorders (e.g., AD, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, Parkinson\u2019s disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) with other etiologies (bacteria, fungus, other viruses), suggesting common pathological mechanisms. It remains to be seen, perhaps with the use of machine learning algorithms, whether our specific panel of combined proteins uniquely identifies neuroLongCOVID-19 and, thus, may serve as biomarkers for this disease.\u201d\n\nSequelae: Heart\n\n\u201cThe role of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing post-COVID-19 thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications\u201d [Heart]. From the Abtract: \u201cWe conducted a staggered cohort study based on national vaccination campaigns using electronic health records from the UK, Spain and Estonia. Vaccine rollout was grouped into four stages with predefined enrolment periods. Each stage included all individuals eligible for vaccination, with no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccine at the start date\u2026. The study included 10.17 million vaccinated and 10.39 million unvaccinated people\u2026.. COVID-19 vaccination reduced the risk of post-COVID-19 cardiac and thromboembolic outcomes. These effects were more pronounced for acute COVID-19 outcomes, consistent with known reductions in disease severity following breakthrough versus unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2 infection.\u201d \u2022 I would want the vaccine types and brands separated out; MRNA vs. killed virus, etc.\n\nSequelae: Cancer\n\n\u201cUS -Death Trends for Neoplasms ICD codes: C00-D48, Ages 15-44\u201d (preprint) [ResearchGate]. From the Abstract: \u201cIn this study we investigate trends in death rates from neoplasms (ICD-10 codes C00-D48) in the USA using crude data from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). We limit our investigation to individuals aged 15 to 44 and for the period of 2010 to 2022\u2026. Using different metrics, we compare mortality trends due to neoplasms before the COVID-19 pandemic with the pandemic period. We show a rise in excess mortality from neoplasms reported as underlying cause of death, which started in 2020 (1.7%) and accelerated substantially in 2021 (5.6%) and 2022 (7.9%). The increase in excess mortality in both 2021 (Z-score of 11.8) and 2022 (Z-score of 16.5) are highly statistically significant (extreme events)\u2026. The results indicate that from 2021 a novel phenomenon leading to increased neoplasm deaths appears to be present in individuals aged 15 to 44 in the US.\n\nSequelae: Long Covid\n\n\u201cSurvey Finds Nearly 7% Of American Adults Have Long Covid Symptoms\u201d [Kaiser Health News]. A roundup of coverage on this CDC \u201cHousehold Pulse\u201d (if any) study.\n\n\u201cLong COVID and Post-COVID Conditions\u201d [Pandemic Patients]. From the introductory paragraphs: \u201cFor many people, being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) results in illness characterized by mild symptoms, resolving in a matter of days or weeks. In fact, research has found that 30-60% of COVID-19 cases may be entirely asymptomatic (Shang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, that is not the only potential outcome, and each infection is a new opportunity for long-term symptoms to develop (Bowe et al., 2022). In fact, some people experience severe, debilitating symptoms that may last for several years and may not improve over time (Fernandez-de-las-Pe\u00f1as et al., 2023). Other people recover from COVID-19, but as a result of the infection, they are now vulnerable to many types of health conditions, known as \u201cpost-COVID conditions,\u201d or \u201cPCCs\u201d (Fernandez-de-las-Pe\u00f1as et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023). These conditions affect nearly every organ in the body and range from benign to life-threatening (Bowe et al., 2022; D\u2019Isabel et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Novak et al., 2022; Fernandez-de-las-Pe\u00f1as et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023; Peter et al., 2022; Abbasi, 2022; Ormiston et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023). However, there is no way to know who will be susceptible to a particular condition until it manifests\u2026. [T]he damage done by COVID-19 is cumulative (Bowe et al., 2022). Even someone who recovers from an asymptomatic (Ma et al., 2023) or mild case (Novak et al., 2022) of COVID-19 is at risk of developing one or more PCCs.\u201d \u2022 This is an enormous document, and I can\u2019t evaluate everything in it. Perhaps some readers will be motivated to look into it and report back.\n\n\u201cAn ER doctor\u2019s experience with long COVID \u2013 \u2018My symptoms seemed endless'\u201d [Hospital News]. \u201cI didn\u2019t get COVID at work. I got it from my junior kindergarten-aged son after kissing him goodnight in between the stairway banisters\u2026. At the time, I remember feeling lucky to be fully vaccinated, and anticipated a full recovery. I returned to work on day 11 after testing positive for COVID, fatigued, but otherwise fine. I was training for a 10-kilometre run, and on day 16 tried to go for a jog. I couldn\u2019t get down the street. I walked home. \u2018That\u2019s odd.\u2019 I thought, believing it was just a premature return to sport. I worked two overnight shifts in the ED that weekend. By day 21, I was suddenly, terrifyingly, sick with something that felt altogether very new. That\u2019s when my life changed forever. After that, long COVID took over my life. My symptoms seemed endless.\u201d But: \u201cMany people ask me what I want the public and physicians to know about long COVID. I think the first is that \u2018the tests are not normal\u2019 \u2013 we are just not ordering the right tests. Every study of long haulers shows unbelievable pathology: immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, brain damage, vascular damage, gut dysbiosis, poor perfusion of the brain, lungs and other organs. We just don\u2019t have an easily accessible biomarker yet.\u201d Thanks, NIH! And: \u201cThe second thing is that while there are no approved treatments for long COVID yet, there IS hope, and there are treatments that help ! Antihistamines, antidepressants for neuroinflammation, aggressive treatment of autonomic dysfunction, or POTS, resting and pacing for post-exertional malaise \u2013 these things can help. The third is that the best way to prevent long COVID is to avoid getting COVID . I use Can95 masks, nasal sprays and HEPA filters\u2026 And finally, we need a rapid acceleration of double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials.\u201d\u2022 Again, thanks NIH, which blew a billion dollars on Long Covid without spending on nickel on the search for biomarkers.\n\nSequelae: Versus Flu\n\n\u201cLong-term outcomes following hospital admission for COVID-19 versus seasonal influenza: a cohort study\u201d [The Lancet]. N = 10 ,985. From the Abstract: \u201cAlthough rates of death and adverse health outcomes following hospital admission for either seasonal influenza or COVID-19 are high, this comparative analysis shows that hospital admission for COVID-19 was associated with higher long-term risks of death and adverse health outcomes in nearly every organ system (except for the pulmonary system) and significant cumulative excess [disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)] than hospital admission for seasonal influenza.\u201d \u2022 So please don\u2019t let anyone tell you \u201cit\u2019s just the flu.\u201d Influenza is bad, and Covid is much worse.\n\n\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic killed off one strain of the flu, and that will change the next vaccines\u201d [CNN]. \u201cYamagata viruses were in decline before the pandemic, and all the precautions that helped people avoid Covid-19 \u2013 including masking, staying at home and better ventilation \u2013 appear to have finished them off. They haven\u2019t been detected in testing since March 2020.\u201d \u2022 Lockdowns aren\u2019t the only reason people might \u201cstay home,\u201d but they were certainly one reason. So the headline is deceptive: \u201cThe pandemic\u201d didn\u2019t kill off anything. NPIs did.

From the Abstract: \u201cWe conducted a literature review focusing on the possible pathophysiology by which severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects men\u2019s sexual and reproductive systems\u2026. Findings revealed the adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 at cellular and organ levels on the male genital tract. However, the reported data are still controversial.\u201d\n\nImmune Dysregulation\n\n\u201cMore attention should be paid to Omicron-associated sepsis: a multicenter retrospective study in south China\u201d [Journal of Thoracic Disease]. N = 299. From the Abstract: \u201d This multicenter retrospective study included adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection across six tertiary hospitals in Guangzhou, China from November 2022 to January 2023. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and its components were calculated at hospital admission to identify sepsis\u2026. In our study, 147 patients (64.19%) were identified as having sepsis upon hospital admission\u2026 A considerable proportion of patients infected with Omicron present with sepsis upon hospital admission, which is associated with a poorer prognosis. Therefore, early recognition of viral sepsis by evaluation of the SOFA score in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients is crucial.\u201d \u2022 Yikes. China only?\n\n\u201cShingles cases are increasing in New South Wales. Experts say COVID might be why\u201d [ABC Australia]. \u201cIn 2022, a paper published by Oxford University Press reported that COVID was linked to an increased risk of shingles in patients over 50. Coincidentally, some data suggests shingles cases have increased across age groups in parts of the country since 2020\u2026. But, pointing to the 2022 study of COVID patients being 15 per cent more likely to develop shingles, [Tony Cunningham, director of Westmead Institute\u2019s Centre for Virus Research] said an explanation could be the immune system. One factor for an increased likelihood of shingles is reduced function of the immune system, the same reason why shingles is more common in older people, Professor Cunningham said. Separately, one side effect of COVID can also be reduced function of our immune system. \u2018We do know that COVID can disturb immunity, particularly the severe causes where you can get variable responses to COVID,\u2019 Professor Cunningham said. \u2018That would be my best bet in the absence of clear evidence.'\u201d\n\n\u201cWorld\u2019s most deadly infection\u2019 can be transmitted simply by breathing, scientists warn \u2013 as cases rise\u201d [The Sun]. \u201cUntil now, healthcare experts thought TB germs were transmitted via coughing, laughing or speaking, singing or sneezing. But a new study has found that four in five people testing positive for the killer bug don\u2019t suffer from a cough \u2013 previously thought to be a key symptom of TB. However, even those who don\u2019t have a cough carry the infectious disease in their spit, which can be spewed into the air when someone talks or breathes, they found. This means people can pick up the infection just by breathing near someone who has the bug but isn\u2019t showing any obvious signs, they said. \u2018A persistent cough is often the entry point for a diagnosis,\u2019 study author Professor Frank Cobelens of Global Health at Amsterdam University Medical Center said. \u2018But if 80 per cent of those with TB don\u2019t have [a cough], then it means that a diagnosis will happen later, possibly after the infection has already been transmitted to many others , or not at all,\u2019 he added.\u201d And: \u201cCases of the Victorian disease increased by over 10 per cent last year, according to the UK Health Security Agency \u2013 up from 4,380 in 2022 to 4,850 in 2023.\u201d But: \u201cHealth chiefs are scrambling to \u2018investigate the reasons\u2019 behind this sudden infection rise.\u201d \u2022 \u2018Tis a mystery!\n\nChildren\n\n\u201cLockdowns had an impact on gut microbes and allergies in newborns, new research reveals\u201d [Science Daily]. \u201cThe findings highlighted gut health benefits for \u2018pandemic babies\u2019 arising from the unique environment of lockdown including lower rates of infection and consequent antibiotic use, and increased duration of breastfeeding.

It Was a List of Absurd Demands of Them\u201d [Science-Based Medicine]. \u201c[L]et\u2019s consider the plan to to \u2018protect the vulnerable\u2019, which was the pillar of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD). How might we have accomplished this laudable goal? Though many people thought the best way to protect the vulnerable was to limit spread of COVID and vaccinate as many people as possible, the GBD claimed that by spreading the virus among hundreds of millions of unvaccinated, \u2018not vulnerable\u2019 Americans, herd immunity would arrive in 3-6 months, and the pandemic would be \u2018naturally over.'\u201d Obviously, that was a debacle, and therefor its proponents are still making bank, along with the neocons who got us unto the Iraq War, Larry Summers, and everyone else who\u2019s wrong about everything. More: \u201cA section of the GBD titled Protecting the Old and Other High-Risk Groups laid out their \u2018plan\u2019, which they called \u2018focused protection.\u2019 You should take 5 minutes and read it. It\u2019s just 880-words long. Their answer to the question \u2018How do we protect older people living at home?\u2019 was only four sentences long\u2026 To pick just one example, the GBD wrote that \u2018During high transmission times, older people should be offered home delivery of groceries and other essentials.\u2019 That sounds nice, but it\u2019s worth thinking seriously about this part of their \u2018plan\u2019 for a moment, something the authors of the GBD clearly did not do. Creating a program overnight to deliver fresh food and other essentials to tens of millions of seniors for months on end while the virus spread uncontrolled would not be an easy task\u2026. In an interview from October 2021, a year after the publication of the GBD, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya sought to answer these questions by saying: \u201cWe could have offered free DoorDash to older people. I mean, yeah, it would depend on the community and the living circumstances. It would be a local thing, right?\u201d This was obviously something Dr. Bhattacharya just thought of off the top of his head. The idea of millions of homebound seniors surviving off DoorDash for months on end is something a high school student might come up with.\u201d \u2022 A high school master debater\u2026\n\n\u201c\u201dPoor, poor pitiful me\u201d: Was Martin Kulldorff fired by Harvard?\u201d [Respectful Insolence]. \u201cIf there is one narrative that is a constant among purveyors of misinformation, pseudoscience, quackery, and conspiracy theories, it\u2019s a persecution narrative. In the realm of medicine and health, for instance, brave maverick doctors (like, for example, Martin Kulldorff) promoting antivaccine views and quackery, as well as the conspiracy theories that undergird them, always portray themselves as the hero persecuted by the medical and scientific establishment. While it is true that there have been physicians with alternative medical theories who were unfairly ostracized and persecuted but turned out to be right (e.g., Ignaz Semmelweis), in the vast majority of cases, the immortal words of Carl Sagan apply: \u2018But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.\u2019\u2026 One of the GBD\u2019s own flacks even (sort of) admitted it. It was always nothing more than an attempt to place a scientific veneer on a libertarian \u2018open it all up\u2019 strategy that would ignore the harms of the pandemic in favor of economics. It arguably did help achieve the cherished aim of anti-government activists and antivaxxers by, in essence, seriously degrading governments\u2019 ability to institute public health measures during a pandemic. Through it all, going on for months and months, Kulldorff kept promising that \u2018natural herd immunity\u2019 was just 3-6 months away.\u201d \u2022 And he\u2019s still making bank, along with Bhattacharya and the other service providers at the house of ill fame that is Standord.\n\n* * *\n\nBallastexistenzen (1):\n\nSome people living with disabilities are worried about the stress of facing unexpected questions about whether they have considered #MAID.

      "article_publisher": "NBC News",
      "article_text": "For weeks, hundreds of people online have spread conspiracy theories, posted memes and cracked jokes in an attempt to answer one question: Where is Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales?\n\nKensington Palace repeatedly said that Kate was recovering from a planned January abdominal surgery. Still, official responses, as well as an edited image posted to the palace\u2019s social media channels, only fueled more unsubstantiated rumors.\n\nBut many people who had partaken in the online frenzy found themselves expressing regret after the princess broke her silence on Friday. In a video message to the public, the 42-year-old wife of Prince William, Britain\u2019s future king, announced she was diagnosed with cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nActress Blake Lively was among the first to make a statement online apologizing for her now-deleted Instagram post, a Photoshop joke inspired by the manipulated Mother\u2019s Day photo released by Kensington Palace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure no one cares today but I feel like I have to acknowledge this,\u201d Lively wrote in an Instagram story. \u201cI made a silly post around the \u2018photoshop fails\u2019 frenzy, and oh man, that post has me mortified today. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment dominated much of the reaction on social media, where users said they wished they hadn\u2019t poked fun at the princess.\n\n\u201cYeah i definitely feel bad about laughing at all the \u2018KateGate\u2019 memes. wishing her a speedy recovery,\u201d wrote Saint Hoax, an influencer who has amassed a following of 3.4 million on Instagram, where they post memes related to current events.\n\nThe fervor around Kate\u2019s whereabouts \u2014 and subsequent online remorse \u2014 has underscored a pattern in which the absence of information provides perfect fodder for creators chasing relevance on algorithm-driven social media platforms.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to jump in to get a piece of the viral pie, so to speak,\u201d said Jessica Maddox, an assistant professor of digital media technology at the University of Alabama. \u201cWhen we look at the intersection of conspiracy theories and social media, particularly content creators, everybody wants to have the hottest take, especially when information isn't known.\u201d\n\nBut Maddox said she hasn\u2019t seen such remorse before in any online conspiracy culture. Usually when internet sleuths are proven wrong, she said, they double down by shifting the goalposts to further deny new evidence and justify their actions.\n\nMany online said Kate\u2019s news also serves as a reminder to stop making assumptions about people\u2019s personal lives.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that\u2019s popped up online before, particularly when celebrities and public figures are overly scrutinized or become the subject of unsupported claims by their followers.\n\nSome fans of actor Chadwick Boseman expressed similar regret about commenting on his weight loss when it was revealed after his death that he had been quietly battling colon cancer for years. In April 2023, pop star Ariana Grande spoke out about the public\u2019s \u201cconcerns\u201d about her body, saying \u201cyou never know what someone is going through.\u201d\n\nThe Kate news has also highlighted the tension between the public\u2019s desire to know every detail about the royal family and the royals\u2019 desire to keep their health struggles private. The princess\u2019 father-in-law, King Charles III, was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. Charles has canceled public engagements while he receives treatment.\n\nReshma Saujani, CEO of nonprofit Girls Who Code, which empowers and equips young girls to pursue careers in STEM, said she felt \u201cdisgusted with the internet\u201d when she heard about Kate\u2019s news.\n\n\u201cDisgusted with the internet and even disgusted with myself because I fell into the trap,\u201d Saujani wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cThis is a classic example of what we do to women, of how when a woman takes time to prioritize her health and take care of her family, we second guess it to the point of coming up with conspiracy theories to explain her self care.\u201d\n\nWith Kate\u2019s news now public, Jessica Myrick, a Pennsylvania State University professor who studies the psychology of media use, suggested that the online chatter surrounding Kate may wind down.\n\nBut, Myrick doesn\u2019t think that social media users will stop creating conspiracy theories online in general, despite expressing some remorse over the Kate news.\n\n\u201cThere are not a lot of consequences for sharing memes on social media, and if anything, the likes that people got, the laughs, the comments ... that\u2019s probably reinforcing and will probably mean we\u2019ll do it all again,\u201d Myrick said.\n\nIn her message on Friday, Kate asked people to respect the family\u2019s privacy.\n\n\u201cWe hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cMy work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery.\u201d",

This is up 22% from a year earlier.\n\nIn a separate development, China's securities regulator launched onsite inspections of some mutual fund companies as part of efforts to strengthen management of the industry, unnerving fund managers.\n\nThe securities watchdog, under newly appointed Chairman Wu Qing, vowed a week ago to set up a \u201ctextbook-style\u201d supervision model to regulate China's $3.8 trillion mutual fund industry, according to Reuters.\n\nThe latest round of inspections, conducted without notice by branches of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), covered daily operations, training, and strengthening internal Chinese Communist Party functions, the 21st Century Business Herald reported on Friday. It did not name the asset managers inspected.\n\nIn response to a Reuters query, CSRC said: \u201cIt's regular on-site inspection that we conduct every year.\u201d\n\nThe CSRC branches inspected fund companies based outside their regions, which the article said can prevent local interference.

This is up 22% from a year earlier.\n\nIn a separate development, China's securities regulator launched onsite inspections of some mutual fund companies as part of efforts to strengthen management of the industry, unnerving fund managers.\n\nThe securities watchdog, under newly appointed Chairman Wu Qing, vowed a week ago to set up a \u201ctextbook-style\u201d supervision model to regulate China's $3.8 trillion mutual fund industry, according to Reuters.\n\nThe latest round of inspections, conducted without notice by branches of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), covered daily operations, training, and strengthening internal Chinese Communist Party functions, the 21st Century Business Herald reported on Friday. It did not name the asset managers inspected.\n\nIn response to a Reuters query, CSRC said: \u201cIt's regular on-site inspection that we conduct every year.\u201d\n\nThe CSRC branches inspected fund companies based outside their regions, which the article said can prevent local interference. Regulators have recently cracked down on computer-driven \u201cquant\u201d private funds.",

The firm cut its full-year pre-tax profit forecast to \u00a3560m in November as it forecast tough conditions through the winter.\n\nInvestors will be looking for an increase in the retailer\u2019s e-commerce activity, which has been seen as a \u201cpotential saviour\u201d for sales going forward, according to Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s Susannah Streeter.\n\nShe added: \u201cWith interest rates eyed on the horizon, UK house prices stabilising, and buyers and sellers gaining confidence, there\u2019s hope that demand for home makeovers and renovations will rise.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBut, although around three-quarters of earnings are driven by the UK, Kingfisher also needs to see improvements in other markets, like France, where the economic climate hasn\u2019t been clement, and rivals like Leroy Merlin are proving tougher competitors.\u2019\u2019\n\nPennon Group\n\nPennon Group\u2019s recent \u00a389m acquisition of Sutton and East Surrey Water will be top of the agenda as it delivers a trading update on Monday.\n\nThe deal is still subject to approval by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), so investors are looking for any insight into how it\u2019s moving forward, alongside an indication of performance ahead of the full-year results in May.\n\n\u201cThe \u00a389m price tag looks attractive and helps Pennon increase its foothold across Southern England by bringing more than 750,000 paying customers into the fold,\u201d Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe deal\u2019s been financed by cash on hand, but because of SES Water\u2019s high levels of debt, Pennon went out and raised \u00a3180m of cash by issuing new equity shares. This will help to keep total debt levels within the group\u2019s target range, while still providing room for its \u00a32.8bn investment plans over the second half of this decade.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOcado\n\nOcado has been involved in a public spat over payments with its half-owner M&S. Nothing as yet has changed about the relationship so investors are looking for business as usual in Tuesday\u2019s trading update.\n\n\u201cLast year, the division saw revenue rise 7 per cent, as higher prices offset a reduction in the number of items being bought. With grocery inflation tempering, investors will be interested to see how performance has developed,\u201d Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n\u201cThere will also be a keen eye on active customer numbers. These were up almost 6 per cent last year and are an important barometer for future demand.\u201d\n\nAway from the FTSE 100, two other closely watched results will come from Fevertree Drinks and the FTSE-250 listed cruise operator Carnival.\n\nFevertree has struggled recently, with full-year revenue expected to come in below expectations. The company has flagged difficult trading in Europe, so investors will be focusing on whether its US segment can provide a tonic.\n\nCarnival is hoping strong booking momentum in the final quarter of last year will continue into 2024. The three months to February are typically the quietest period of the year, but investors will get some insight into forward bookings.",

      "article_text": "It was another busy week for the UK economy in which we got fresh data on inflation and another interest rate decision from the Bank of England.\n\nBefore asking where it all leaves the UK economy, its worth a quick recap.\n\nOn Wednesday, inflation fell to 3.4 per cent thanks largely to falling food prices. This was slightly lower than the 3.5 per cent expected by economists. Services inflation also fell, but remained elevated at 6.1 per cent.\n\nBefore the Bank of England met on Thursday, S&P\u2018s closely watch purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) showed the UK economy continued to expand at a \u201crobust\u201d pace in March, albeit at a slightly lower pace than February. However, cost pressures for firms were also still high.\n\nThe big event. As expected the Bank of England left interest rates on hold, but hawkish dissent on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) dissipated. The statement said policy would remain restrictive even after rates were cut. A June start date looked increasingly likely after the decision.\n\nFinally a health-check on the UK consumer. Consumer confidence stalled in March, remaining at its February level, while retail sales volumes were flat month-on-month despite a very wet month.\n\nWhat to make of all of this? Whisper it, but things are starting to look fairly good for the UK economy.\n\nThe UK economy, rightly or wrongly, is driven by consumption. With regards to consumption, most economic indicators turned markedly more positive at the start of the year. For example, consumer confidence hit a two-year high in January; retail sales rebounded robustly from a poor December; and the PMI hit a nine-month high in February.\n\nThis week\u2019s surveys suggest that the economy has maintained its early momentum, even if it has not yet been able to take off to a new level.\n\nHowever, this week gives us two very good reasons to think that things will continue getting better.\n\nFirst, inflation. Most economists think inflation will be back to target by April thanks to Ofgem\u2019s energy price cap, although there is some debate about where it will then pick back up again later in the year.\n\nWage growth meanwhile remains fairly hot, even if it too is on a downward trend. If prices continue rising slower at a slower pace than wages, then people will have more money to spend and momentum will continue building.\n\nThis will only support consumer spending.\n\nThe second factor is interest rates. We got our surest signal yet that interest rate cuts are on the way with a June cut now looking more likely than not.\n\nThis has already started feeding through into lower mortgage rates and will continue to do so as the year progresses.\n\nEconomists argued lower inflation and falling interest rates would support consumption in the year ahead.\n\n\u201cWe think the stars are aligning for stronger consumer spending growth this year,\u201d Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSimilarly, Ellie Henderson, UK economist at Investec said \u201cbrighter days are ahead for the UK consumer\u201d.\n\nBy Chris Dorrell via CityAM\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

      "article_text": "As always, the inflation figures followed by the MPC meeting and its resultant Bank Base Rate (BBR) vote, provides us with plenty to delve into, albeit on this occasion without any suggestion of dial-moving changes in terms of housing activity. At least not yet.\n\nThat being said, certainly a drop in inflation, followed by a tangible move in voting patterns from MPC members, does appear to show a much clearer path to a first Bank Base Rate cut, and potentially the much-anticipated increase in consumer confidence that such a move might deliver.\n\nWhile the inflation drop to 3.4% was perhaps more than expected, it still felt like a big step for the MPC to make to then follow that up with a BBR cut, and so it proved, however it\u2019s clear that the noises coming out of the Bank of England \u2013 especially with the suggestion that inflation could be at its 2% target in the next few months \u2013were much more \u2018cut-friendly\u2019 shall we say.\n\nIndeed, the voting patterns of MPC members appear to prove this. Lest we forget that in February, two members voted for an increase in BBR, while one voted for a cut then, and the other six voted to keep the status quo.\n\nThis month that had moved quite noticeably, with the two members who had previously thought a further rise was necessary now falling into the \u2018hold\u2019 camp, while we still had one member looking for that early cut.\n\nNow, on the surface, that might not seem like a big deal, but the fact this change of heart had happened within six weeks or so is definitely worthy of note, and with the Governor, Andrew Bailey, using the MPC meeting to talk up the prospects of a rate cut in the not too distant future, I think we move much closer to this. Especially if inflation does get closer and closer to target.\n\nWhat should perhaps also be factored into this situation, is that we now wait almost two months before the next MPC meeting, which will not take place until the 9th May.\n\nInterestingly, this is after the Local Elections, and what price a rate cut then which might foreseeably help the Conservative government distract from what many political commentators believe will be a damaging set of results?\n\nOf course the Bank is independent of this, but as mentioned, if we have seen further falls in inflation, and with Bailey saying explicitly that the MPC doesn\u2019t necessarily need to see it at 2% before it cuts, then we could have that first drop in May. Or perhaps June.\n\nCertainly, the markets are anticipating two to three cuts in BBR this year, and while swaps have been up and down lately, when we get tangible proof of that, then the mortgage market should see the benefits in terms of product pricing, albeit with the caveat that we shouldn\u2019t expect big drops in mortgage rates.\n\nThis, of course, is a market that thrives on confidence and, dare I say it, lower rates. We all saw the impact of this in December/January and February when lenders were able to cut pricing, and this acted as a catalyst for greater demand in both the purchase and remortgage spaces.\n\nIn lieu of anything game-changing from the Budget, it is likely to be rates that do most of the heavy-lifting within the mortgage market over the course of 2024, and from that perspective, advisers should not be backward in coming forward in marketing these to both new and existing clients.\n\nFew mortgage borrowers are uninterested in the cost of their mortgage, especially if they are coming to the end of the deal, and they are anticipating a big increase in monthly costs. If you\u2019re able to find them a pathway to less of an increase, all well and good, but borrowers need to be told about this and they need to know that their best chance of this is via you, not direct.\n\nAs we know the PT route might be right for some borrowers \u2013 as we saw last year it might be the only option they have \u2013 but increasingly, and with rates coming off last year\u2019s highs, a remortgage might now be more suitable. And, with those remortgages, comes opportunities that simply do not exist in the PT space for advisers, not least ancillary sales generated by other customer needs including protection, GI, conveyancing, and the like.\n\nIn that sense, I would make the most of market chatter. Clearly, we\u2019ve not seen BBR cuts yet, but they look inevitable. Get ahead of this in the mind of your clients and make sure they know exactly where they need to go in order to make the most of what should be more competitive options for them in the months to come.\n\nKeith Young is managing director of Broker Conveyancing",

However, there were some smaller issues that needed to be re-examined.\n\nThe H7 licence period runs between January 2022 until December 2026.\n\nFurther H7 Adjustments\n\nLooking through the CMAs appeal, the regulator has made further adjustments to its H7 licence, including the following \u2013\n\nThrough additional corrections, the difference between Heathrow Airport\u2019s actual and allowed revenues in both 2020 and 2021.

      "article_text": "Rumours that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt planned to introduce a 99% LTV mortgage designed to help first-time buyers (FTBs) get a foot on the property ladder in the Spring Budget dominated headlines last month.\n\nWhile the finer details of the supposed government-backed policy were rather scant, the news sparked a significant level of debate and criticism among commentators over its legitimacy but the idea was scrapped as quickly as it had apparently been conceived.\n\nOne of the major objections to the proposed scheme was that having a smaller deposit risked leaving buyers in negative equity if house prices were to drop significantly in the future.\n\nAnother concern was that, although it would ease the pressure on FTBs when saving for a deposit, it would not make the cost of buying a property any more affordable, especially in the higher interest rate environment.\n\nGiven the fact that the concept of a 99% mortgage was not too far removed from a product that already exists in the market \u2013 the 100% mortgage \u2013 the furore and attention surrounding the proposed scheme came as somewhat of a surprise.\n\nAlongside many other lenders, we have been offering 100% mortgage products for quite some time, therefore, a government-backed 99% mortgage product did not seem such an unusual concept.\n\nWhile it is certainly true that 100% mortgages have come under a fair amount of criticism over the years, this type of lending solution can offer a perfectly viable alternative for those borrowers who are looking to get onto the property ladder but are struggling to raise a deposit.\n\nThere are many different variations of this type of mortgage in the market today and understanding what they are and how they work is important when addressing the needs of a variety of clients.\n\nFor example, here at The Loughborough, we have a suite of family assist mortgage solutions including a family deposit product which enables the borrower to take out a 100% LTV mortgage and have another family member (typically parents) guarantee a deposit of up to 20% of the purchase price.\n\nThis can be done by placing a collateral charge against the depositor\u2019s own property or as a cash lump sum into a savings account offering a 3% interest rate. In both scenarios, the deposit is released after seven years, or sooner if there is enough equity in the property when it is time to remortgage.\n\nThis can prove to be an attractive solution for parents and family members in the current higher interest rate environment where gifting a deposit may no longer be financially viable. Instead, a family assist mortgage not only means they will get their money back; they will also earn interest on their money while still helping their child buy a house.\n\nA similar proposition is available through our Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor (JBSP) Deposit Guarantee product which enables a family member to provide a 20% security against their house or as cash held in a deposit guarantee account, while also boosting the applicant\u2019s borrowing capacity by using family members\u2019 income for affordability purposes.\n\nAgain, in most cases, this tends to be the borrower\u2019s parents, but other family members such as grandparents, siblings and aunts and uncles can also be listed on the application, although the property will only be legally owned by the occupier.\n\nAs with all forms of borrowing, there will always be an element of risk involved and family members should ensure they seek legal advice to understand what would happen if the borrower failed to keep up with mortgage payments.\n\nGiven the level of complexity involved in these applications, it is important to note that each one is individually assessed and underwritten to ensure maximum affordability for the client. This also enables brokers to get answers to any questions they may have regarding the application process.\n\nNot only does this help to provide surety of service and outcome, it also allows brokers to help their clients explore every avenue of getting on the property ladder and achieve their homeownership aspirations in an innovative yet responsible manner.\n\nAshley Pearson is head of intermediaries at Loughborough Building Society",

      "article_text": "It\u2019s been evident over the past 12 to 18 months that first-time buyers have found it increasingly tough from an affordability perspective during such turbulent economic times and amidst rising cost of living pressures. While this may have been a disheartening period for many, the major positive to take from this is that demand remains strong amongst this vital band of borrowers.\n\nAlthough, it\u2019s also fair to say that all parties involved in the homebuying process continue to require additional assistance when it comes to opening more doors for first-time buyers and in helping to bridge a cavernous supply gap which continues to widen.\n\nOn this very subject, a poll in our Game Changer webinar series which took place at the beginning of February revealed that over a third of property professionals were looking towards the reintroduction of Help To Buy or some government-led initiative announcement in the then upcoming Budget to help boost the new build sector and first-time buyer marketplace.\n\nBreaking down the responses to the question \u2013 what do you most want to see from the Chancellor in March\u2019s Budget, 35% of respondents replied with Help To Buy or something to support new build and first-time buyers. 22% sought a stamp duty holiday/reduction, 17% opted for an inheritance tax cut, 16% chose stamp duty changes for downsizers and 10% elected for additional landlord support.\n\nWe are now on the other side of this important political landmark and while expectations were not exactly unbridled, the phrase \u2018missed opportunity\u2019 has emerged as the most common reaction amongst many industry commentators and left these respondents a little deflated.\n\nThankfully, the housing and mortgage markets are proving to be highly resilient entities and we should certainly take great comfort and confidence from this fact moving forward.\n\nWhen evaluating the 2024 UK property market, 41% of the webinar respondents suggested that there was cause for optimism, with the same proportion saying that there is \u2018possibly\u2019 cause for optimism. 13% stated that they were \u2018unsure\u2019 about the marketplace with 5% saying that there was \u2018probably not\u2019 any cause for optimism. However, on a brighter note, not one property professional in the audience suggested a definite \u2018no\u2019 cause for optimism for the UK property market over the next 12 months.\n\nThe 2024 property market will undoubtedly see a rise in the value attached to expertise throughout the industry. Leading professionals in their fields such as estate agents, surveyors, conveyancers and mortgage intermediaries will play an even more integral role in ensuring that the ongoing needs of FTBs, second steppers, downsizers, landlords and investors are being successfully met, with the highest service standards being duly rewarded.\n\nAnd let\u2019s hope this vast knowledge base is utilised to improve a somewhat cumbersome homebuying journey and deliver a Spring bounce which can help further propel this optimism to new levels and build on what has been a solid start to the year from an enquiry and transactional standpoint.\n\nMatthew Cumber is managing director of Countrywide Surveying Services",

      "article_text": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, meme coins have carved out a unique niche, captivating investors with their whimsical appeal and community-driven ethos. Among the notable contenders in this space are FLOKI, PEPE, and Furrever Token (FURR), each offering its own brand of charm and potential for growth. While FLOKI and PEPE have already gained traction as successful meme coins, Furrever Token (FURR) is emerging as a promising contender, poised to make waves on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) following in the footsteps of PEPE\u2019s success. As meme coins continue to capture the imagination of crypto enthusiasts worldwide, the stage is set for FURR to shine as the next big thing in the meme coin arena.\n\nFLOKI (FLOKI) Shows Signs of Recovery: Plans for Regulated Digital Banking Account Spark Optimism\n\nFLOKI (FLOKI) is currently priced at around $0.0002316, marking an increase of over 2.5% since yesterday. This uptick in price has generated optimism among investors, signaling potential recovery in the FLOKI market. Adding to this positive sentiment is a recent announcement from the project\u2019s lead developer, B, revealing plans for a groundbreaking initiative. It has been disclosed that the FLOKI community is exploring the possibility of introducing a regulated digital banking account, allowing users to fund their accounts with (FLOKI) tokens denominated in dollars, euros, and pounds sterling. This innovative approach not only enhances the utility of FLOKI but also expands its use case into the realm of traditional banking services. As the project continues to push boundaries and explore new avenues for adoption, investors are increasingly bullish on FLOKI\u2019s future prospects.\n\nPepe (PEPE) Whales Make Massive Purchases: Significant Market Movement Detected\n\nPepe (PEPE) is currently priced at about $0.000007566, showing a decline of over 8% in the past week. Despite this, significant attention has been drawn to the meme coin due to two notable investments made by influential investors, often referred to as \u201cwhales.\u201d These investors have collectively acquired a massive 560.2 billion PEPE coins, sparking discussions and speculation within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nSpot On Chain, a leading cryptocurrency analytics platform, has highlighted these substantial purchases, which coincide with a significant 11% price increase in PEPE over the last 24 hours. The acquisitions by the whales come amidst a rebound in PEPE\u2019s price following a recent crash in the crypto market, suggesting a strategic maneuver to capitalize on market volatility.\n\nThe first investor, identified by their blockchain address as 0xd93, made a significant investment of $3.86 million, diversifying between 3.67 million USDC and 300 WTAO. This individual has previously realized substantial profits from PEPE trading, showcasing their proficiency in navigating the volatile market. On the other hand, the second investor, known as 0x522, pursued a different strategy, exchanging 42.08 billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) and 64 Ethereum (ETH) valued at $1.12 million and $224,000, respectively, for 100 billion PEPE coins. This transaction was facilitated through Binance, underscoring the widespread reach of PEPE trading activities.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Continues to Shine Amidst Market Downturn with Up to 15X Returns\n\nDespite the prevailing market downturn, Furrever Token (FURR) stands out as a beacon of positivity, captivating investors with its unique charm and promising trajectory.

This presale has proven to be immensely popular, with Furrever Token already raising over $430,000 and nearing completion of stage 4 out of 10. Despite the market challenges, FURR\u2019s presale success highlights the unwavering enthusiasm of investors for the project\u2019s vision and tokenomics. With a fundraising goal of $1 million, Furrever Token is well on its way to achieving its targets, setting the stage for a successful launch on decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap.\n\nWith a current price of $0.000312 and the potential for significant returns of up to 15X, Furrever Token presents an enticing investment opportunity amidst the market turbulence.

      "article_text": "Like many, I was confused by Will Hutton's arguments in The Observer today, in which he argued that Rachael Reeves has given Britain \u201cthe plan for economic lift off\u201d. Unsurprisingly, I disagree with him.\n\nLet me summarise my argument at the outset. I think Will Hutton is looking for a job. I cannot explain what he is saying in any other way.\n\nThen let me move to the detail. Will is arguing, as I can see it, three things.\n\nFirst, his suggestion is that those who have tried to impose policy on the economy have always got things wrong. He quotes Polanyi, who he interprets as saying that it was the imposition of centrally dictated policy that gave rise to the extremist backlashes of the 1930s. As a result, he seems to be applauding her for backing away from that central planning. Doing so, he ignores his own past demands, and what most would think to be the critical economic social democratic role of any government, which is to constrain the errors, excesses and inappropriate directions of market economics. Perhaps he is, however, revealing that he really has been a disciple of Hayek all along, whilst also revealing that he thinks she is. I really can't work out what else he is trying to say.\n\nThen, entirely paradoxically, he endorses her claim that this is an inflection point where what he describes as \u201ca new productivist economic paradigm is emerging\u201d which he argues is \u201cvital for economic growth and social cohesion through higher public investment, an active industrial policy and quality public services.\u201d Anyone who can reconcile this second argument with his first, noted above, deserves a prize.\n\nThird, he then argues that adopting Jeremy Hunt's fiscal rules, as she is, will not in any way constrain her ambition to deliver this plan for growth. His reasons for saying so are, as far as I can work out, twofold. First, he seems to suggest that the rule is just for show because the figures can always be fudged to make it work. This might be a frank recognition of reality, but it does not constitute either a fiscal plan, or economic sense. Then, the paradox continues, because having firstly condemned central planning, and then praised it, he then seeks to reconcile his positions and the use of this fiscal rule by suggesting that the job of government will, in Rachael Reeves opinion, be to direct the way in which private capital will be invested, because the government is not going to make any available. In that way the fiscal rule is upheld but the desired growth is delivered in accordance with a plan for which Reeves can then take credit. Quite why he thinks that this might be possible he does not say, because very obviously Rachael Reeves does not know either, if that is what she really thinks.\n\nBut then, there's a great deal that Rachael Reeves does not know or say. She does not say how she will tackle poverty. Nor has she got a plan to save local government. The NHS can only be presumed to be up for sale. There is no money for education. Devolution, as ever, got no proper mention from Reeves. And apparently, all this can be ignored because the right wing press would criticise Reeves if she did discuss such issues, so Will Hutton thinks she need not do so.\n\nI am sure, as I mentioned at the outset, that Will Hutton had a reason for writing this article, but the piece is itself profoundly confused in an attempt to endorse Reeves' own incoherence. If this is indication of the current level of centre-right thinking around Reeves (where she, herself, is located on the political spectrum) it is a pretty depressing foretaste of the disaster that Labour will be.",
